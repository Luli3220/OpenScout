This creates the file `target/scala-2.12/example-fastopt.js`.\nYou can now open `index-fastopt.html` in your favorite Web browser!\n\nDuring development, it is useful to use `~fastOptJS` in sbt, so that each\ntime you save a source file, a compilation of the project is triggered.\nHence only a refresh of your Web page is needed to see the effects of your\nchanges.\n\n## Run the tests\n\nTo run the test suite, execute the task `test`. If you have installed\n[Node.js](http://nodejs.org/), you can use that runtime to run the tests,\nwhich is faster:\n\n    > set scalaJSStage in Global := FastOptStage\n    > test\n\n## The fully optimized version\n\nFor ultimate code size reduction, use `fullOptJS`. This will take several\nseconds to execute, so typically you only use this for the final, production\nversion of your application. While `index-fastopt.html` refers to the\nJavaScript emitted by `fastOptJS`, `index.html` refers to the optimized\nJavaScript emitted by `fullOptJS`.\n\nIf Node.js is installed, the tests can also be run in their fully optimized\nversion with:\n\n    > set scalaJSStage in Global := FullOptStage\n    > test\n"

It has been superseded by [Akka.js](https://github.com/akka-js/akka.js).**\n\nThis project aims at providing an actor system for Scala.js, featuring:\n\n*   Supervision\n*   (Almost) transparent collaboration with actors in an Akka-based backend\n*   Transparent collaboration with actors in several Web Workers\n\nIt is currently a prototype, working well but still in a rough shape. Hence,\nit is not published anywhere yet.\n\n## Build it and try the examples\n\nTo build the libraries, use\n\n    > package\n\nin an sbt console.\n\n### Fault-tolerance example\n\nThe fault-tolerance example is taken from Akka's documentation and showcases\nsupervision, death watch notifications and the like.\n\nBuild it with:\n\n    > faultToleranceExample/fastOptJS\n\nthen open `examples/faulttolerance/index-fastopt.html` in your browser and look\nat the Web console for the output.\n\n### Web Workers example\n\nThe Web Workers example demonstrates the communication between Web Workers.\n\nBuild it with:\n\n    > webworkersExample/fastOptJS\n\nthen open `examples/webworkers/index-fastopt.html` in your browser and look at\nthe Webconsole for the output.\n\n### Chat example (with client-server communication)\n\nThe Chat example is a full-stack Play/Akka/Scala.js application where client\nand server communicate transparently between Akka/JVM and \"Akka/JS\".\n\nBuild the client then run the server with:\n\n    > chatExampleScalaJS/fullOptJS\n    > project chatExample\n    [scalajs-actors-examples-chat] $ run\n\nthen navigate to [http://localhost:9000/opt](http://localhost:9000/opt) with\nyour browser. To have some fun, open multiple tabs (or multiple browsers) and\nstart playing with the chat.\n\n## Design documentation\n\nThe best source of documentation for the design at large is\n[this report](http://lampwww.epfl.ch/~doeraene/scalajs-actors-design.pdf).\n\n## License\n\nScala.js actors is distributed under the\n[Scala License](http://www.scala-lang.org/license.html).\n"
