However, it allows you to use shorter commands to achieve tasks that'd commonly require multiple commands.\n\n## Requirements\n\n* bash >= 4\n* bc\n* binutils\n* coreutils\n* curl\n* file\n* grep\n* hexdump\n* html2text\n* perl\n* sed\n* wget\n* xxd\n* zip\n\n## Installation\n\nUse the *make* command to generate a single file containing all functions and add it to your ```/etc/bash.bashrc``` file:\n\n    make\n    make install\n\n That's all. You can now check the available functions from command line by typing *bh_* and pressing TAB.\n\n## Documentation\n\nThere's some [here](https://bashacks.readthedocs.io/), but it is outdated. PRs are welcome!\n\n## Usage\n\nWhat time is now in Epoch?\n\n    $ bh_epoch\n    1522324129\n\nAlphabetically add 4 to 'f'\n\n    $ bh_charcalc f + 4\n    j\n\nCheck my external IP address\n\n    $ bh_myip\n    177.212.113.13\n\nCreate a basic C program skeleton\n\n    $ bh_skel_c > hello.c\n    $ cat hello.c\n    #include <stdio.h>\n\n    int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {\n\n\n        return 0;\n    }\n\nCalculate common checksums for files\n\n    $ bh_hashes /bin/ip*\n    387478f58a0669173fb6557d392a58e9 /bin/ip\n    1dd0f3b100bd6efc4664da0cdefff801d7d2efd8 /bin/ip\n    1d418ae3a767280c7fc6026a25e5bb9774c0e8afc7b3387b547765b62cbe578f /bin/ip\n    78868acd29e4a33194fb786f6589d3d1 /bin/ipcmk\n    8c22a129ff4b5748cc62222a93ba8471d7fdce19 /bin/ipcmk\n    34a068d7f85e85746b3fc98502fa96a734cc51f3a9d49cad92911e8f239bd9c9 /bin/ipcmk\n    69c2bedc20e77c039912c9d5e7af33db /bin/ipcrm\n    7992a936b28359d7f087a448d2b8a2418ef4f112 /bin/ipcrm\n    cded383eb3b74467409c1731c2804350fe3d1123bdac7304c1c6f3af9e7976f7 /bin/ipcrm\n    499f17765c0aa55ac99739c9bcac1d0c /bin/ipcs\n    c476949e77ef8710398fd8ec4f78c8cf1d76a420 /bin/ipcs\n    33c77a5b625f4de919f55dc24207645d219a2fde2e0b92be27c5cda8c662cd72 /bin/ipcs\n    6a738c5c2506f7e87c9458e0c3df378f /bin/iptables-xml\n    ba97af2e429aca6beb5a2b8861e370bbf874dee9 /bin/iptables-xml\n    cb8c10461da5247e8d6d63a123ba563df95ae1e78f29e1717eb8bb02c2ca045b /bin/iptables-xml\n\nFind files by MIME type (ignores file extension):\n\n    $ bh_findmime -elf /bin | head\n    /bin/[\n    /bin/addpart\n    /bin/appres\n    /bin/apt\n    /bin/apt-cache\n    /bin/apt-cdrom\n    /bin/apt-config\n    /bin/apt-extracttemplates\n    /bin/apt-ftparchive\n    /bin/apt-get\n\nYou could pipe the results to xargs in order to calculate checksums quickly:\n\n    $ bh_findmime -pe ~/Downloads/ | xargs shasum\n    d9e49c4209087170e36cbef689d96240d736cf3b  /Users/menteb/Downloads/CSCWCNG.dll\n    50dfeea02e89f41caf52df152c7cb923c667bffc  /Users/menteb/Downloads/Receitanet-1.10.exe\n    86a5f89d43ab11456fb817aeceb14b83cc6c2608  /Users/menteb/Downloads/Xojo2017r3Setup.exe.opdownload\n\nConvert string to hex in differe\n...

It has a series of collectors that will gather samples from many sources and shove them into the pipeline. The sample manager has a series of plugins that are ran against the sample and returns found data into JSON form.\n\nThese JSON data can be further processed and queried in a objective manner instead of *grepping and regexing*.\n\n## How?\nThe main Aleph daemon is a loose-coupled python application and library. These are composed by the Aleph Service that spawns:\n\n1. The Collectors. These are responsible for going to multiple sources (Filesystem folder, IMAP folder, FTP directory etc) and collect all the files there, store locally and add them to the processing queue. Each collector runs in its own process (fork).\n2. Multiple (quantity is configurable) parallel SampleManager services (that will pull samples from the work queue and process them) and run the plugins that receives the sample path and return the JSON object of found artifacts.\n3. The sample object is converted to JSON along with its data and is stored into an Elasticsearch backend.\n\n## Installing Aleph\n### Requirements\nIn order to get a clean and nice install, you should download some requirements:\nUbuntu/Debian\n\n\tapt-get install python-pyrex libffi-dev libfuzzy-dev python-dateutil libsqlite3-dev\n\t\n\n#### ElasticSearch\nFirst if you don't have an [Elasticsearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org/) instance ready, you must install one. \n\nFor Debian/Ubuntu/Redhat/Fedora/CentOS (yum + apt basically) users, follow [this guide](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/setup-repositories.html).\n\n** Remember: Elasticsearh uses JVM, so you also must install it =) **\n\n#### Python modules\nWe strongly suggest that you use python's virtual environment so you don't pollute the rest of your OS installation with python modules. To make a contained virtual environment, install _virtualenv_ with _pip_:\n\n    pip install virtualenv\n\nGo to the desired Aleph installation folder and type the following to create and activate your virtual environment:\n\n    virtualenv venv # 'venv' can be any name\n    source venv/bin/activate\n\nThere will be the environment name (venv) appended to your PS1 variable:\n\n    (venv)(2014-08-19 17:36:%)(~/opt/aleph/)\n\nAll python modules required are listed on the _requirements.txt_ file on the root repository folder. You can install all of them at once using _pip_:\n\n    pip install -r requirements.txt\n\nThen clone the repository and copy the settings file:\n\n    git clone https://github.com/merces/aleph.git --branch aleph-python --single-branch .\n    cp aleph/settings.py.orig aleph/settings.py\n\nEdit settings.py and add a local sou\n...

      "README.md": "# entropy\n\n`entropy` is a simple command-line tool to calculate the entropy of files.\n\n## Why\n\nThe [entropy of a file](https://kennethghartman.com/blog/calculate-file-entropy/) tells us how random the file is.\nThe closer to `8.00`, the more random the file is.\n\nAs compression and encryption algorithms' output usually consists of high entropy data, one can say\nany file with entropy `greater than 7.0` is likely compressed, encrypted, or packed (in case of executables).\n\nI needed a fast way to calculate the entropy for a bunch of files at once in Windows, so I ended up coding\nthis tool, which can also be used in Linux, macOS, and likely other operating systems.\n\n## Download\n\nWindows releases are available [here](https://github.com/merces/entropy/releases). In order to run them, you need the latest [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist)\ninstalled.\n\nTo run it in other operating systems, check the [Building](#Building) section.\n\n## Usage\n\nCalculating the entropy of a single file:\n\n    ./entropy /bin/ls\n    5.85 /bin/ls\n\nShell expansion is supported too:\n\n    PS C:\\> .\\entropy.exe C:\\Users\\User\\Downloads\\*\n    7.92 C:\\Users\\User\\Downloads\\1.jpeg\n    8.00 C:\\Users\\User\\Downloads\\setup.exe\n    7.58 C:\\Users\\User\\Downloads\\nov.pptx\n    4.66 C:\\Users\\User\\Downloads\\data.bin\n    7.99 C:\\Users\\User\\Downloads\\pic.png\n    4.07 C:\\Users\\User\\Downloads\\budget.xls\n\nFrom the above output one could say `/bin/ls` is not packed, `1.jpeg` uses compression,\n`setup.exe` is compressed, `nov.pptx` is compressed (yup, these modern MS Office files are all\nZIP files indeed), `data.bin` is not compressed, etc. Is that garuanteed? No, it's just math. :nerd_face:\n\n## Building\n\n### Linux/macOS\n\nClone the repo:\n\n    git clone https://github.com/merces/entropy.git\n    cd entropy\n\nIf you have CMake installed, build with the following commands:\n\n    mkdir build\n    cd build\n    cmake ..\n    make\n\nOr if you don't, just use `g++`:\n\n    g++ -std=c++20 -o entropy entropy.cpp\n\n### Windows\n\nIf you use a recent Visual Studio version, you can clone this repository and open the `CMakeLists.txt` here\nwith `File -> Open -> CMake...`. Then, select a configuration that suits your needs and build.\n\n## Similar Work\n\nI am aware of the following tools that achieve similar results:\n\n| Name                                                                        | Comments                                                                |\n| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| [DensityScout](https://cert.at/en/downloads/software/software-densityscout) | Uses a different algorithm the author called density.                   |\n| [Detect It Easy](https://github.com/horsicq/Detect-It-Easy)                 | Shows a nice graph.
