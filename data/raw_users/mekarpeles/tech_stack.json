The objective of this project is to (a) make bboyte's code more accessible and (b) illustrate, in a readable way, the fundamentals of captcha cracking. It's primary goal is clarity and makes no claims or attempts at efficiency, accuracy, or practicality.\n\nThis work is a derivation of an original work by @boyter\n<bboyte01@gmail.com>, http://www.boyter.org/decoding-captchas/ (see\norigin tutorial at\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20121012023114/http://www.wausita.com/captcha/)\n\n## Installation\n\nOn ubuntu, libjpeg-dev and libpng-dev may be system requirements for the Python Pillow (PIL) library \n\n    sudo apt-get install libjpeg-dev\n    sudo apt-get install libpng-dev\n    \nNext, fetch and build the decaptcha library\n\n    pip install git+https://github.com/mekarpeles/captcha-decoder.git\n\n## Usage\n\nThe decaptcha library comes with a command line utility called `decaptca`. Running the command with `-h` will show a list of options. The <img> argument can be provided a filepath or a url:\n\n    usage: decaptcha [-h] [-v] [-l LIMIT] [-c CHANNELS] [-t THRESHOLD] [--min MIN]\n                     [--max MAX] [-o TOLERANCE]\n                     [<img>]\n    \n    Python captcha cracking utility\n    \n    positional arguments:\n      <img>                 Enter the filesystem path or url of a captcha image\n    \n    optional arguments:\n      -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n      -v                    Displays the decaptcha version\n      -l LIMIT, --limit LIMIT\n                            Package url\n      -c CHANNELS, --channels CHANNELS\n                            The number of prominant color channels to keep\n      -t THRESHOLD, --threshold THRESHOLD\n                            Accuracy threshold for matching decimal [0-1]\n      --min MIN             Filter out colors darker than this [0-256]\n      --max MAX             Filter out colors light than this [0-256]\n      -o TOLERANCE, --tolerance TOLERANCE\n                            Pixel tolerance for character segmentation. Higher is\n                            more lenient/greedy, lower is strict.\n\n# Example\n\n    $ decaptcha http://www.mondor.org/img/capex.jpg  --min 0 --max 20 --limit 5 --channels 5 --tolerance 7\n    \n    Character 0 of 7:\n            t (confidence of 0.839150063096)\n            e (confidence of 0.827405543276)\n    Character 1 of 7:\n            0 (confidence of 0.834057656228)\n            l (confidence of 0.771064160322)\n    Character 2 of 7:\n            t (confidence of 0.309437274354)\n            e (confidence of 0.303227199152)\n    Character 3 of 7:\n    Character 4 of 7:\n            t (confiden\n...

The pypc project aspires to integrate with the Python Packaging Authority `pip` tool to provide users with a standard, sane approach to creating python packages (via a command such as `pip create <package>`. Currently, pypc works similarly to git and will populate your current directory with the appropriate project files.\n\nInstallation\n============\n\n    $ pip install pypc\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nPypc helps you create the basic structure of your python\npackage. It uses the conventions and file structure outlined in\nhttps://packaging.python.org/en/latest/distributing.html. Advanced options\nexist for additionally automatically setting up virtualenv for your project,\npip install dependencies and linters, such as pyflakes and pep8, auto-generating\na pip freeze as requirements.txt, and creating command line entry points for your package.\n\nThe most basic example is `pypc <package-name>` which will populate your current working directory with\nthe correct project files. E.g:\n\n    $ pypc project && ls\n    \n    CHANGES  docs/  examples/  LICENSE  MANIFEST.in  project/  README.md  setup.py  tox.in\n\nPypc also offers a -m or --minimal flag for purists who wish to generate only the minimal requirements. This\nonly creates a README and setup.py and does not require network access\n(after pypc is installed).\n\n    # Minimal install\n\n    $ pypc -m project && ls\n\n    project/  MANIFEST.in  README.rst  setup.py setup.cfg\n\nIn both cases, a project/ subdirectory is populated with an __init__.py.\n\nFinally, pypc provides a --strict or -s mode which not only scaffolds your\nproject directory but additionally installs and activates\nvirtualenv and linters within your environment. Strict mode may be combined\nwith minimal mode:\n\n    $ pypc -sm project\n\nOptions\n=======\n\n    usage: pypc [-h] [-v] [-m] [-s] [--venv VENV] [--path PATH] [--author AUTHOR]\n                [--email EMAIL] [-V VERSION] [--desc DESC] [--url URL]\n                [--rm README] [--fs FS]\n                pkgname\n\nIf you only want to create a package with a setup.py (no virtual env,\netc), use the -m or --minimal flag.\n\nNote: -v outputs the version of pypc whereas -V or --version is used to\n specify the initial version of the package you are creating. This is\n slightly confusion, and improvements are welcome.\n\nLibrary\n=======\nPypc can be imported and used as library.\n\n    >>> from pypc.create import Package\n    >>> p = Package(\"pkgname\", path=\"~/optional\") # defaults to os.getcwd()\n    >>> p.new(**{'readme': 'README.md'}) # see pypc.settings.DEFAULTS for a list of default options (key,vals)\n\nPhilosopy\n=========\n* KISS. Small and simple enough (i.e. Flask/webpy, not django) that it can be integrated into pip,\n* Defaults. a default modus of operandi which works offline,\n* PEP 20. \"\n... (truncated)"
