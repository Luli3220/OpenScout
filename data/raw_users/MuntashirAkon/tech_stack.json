We support only this app, not your device's system software. Settings Database Editor (SetEdit) is invaluable if you need it, but if you're not careful you're very likely to mess something up.\n\nBy default, for your protection, Android prevents you from modifying the **SECURE** and **GLOBAL** tables. If you have Android Jellybean or later, you can remove this protection from an ADB shell using the following command:\n```shell\npm grant io.github.muntashirakon.setedit android.permission.WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS\n```\nOn earlier versions, you can only remove this protection on a rooted device by installing SetEdit to the system partition.\n\nBoth `WRITE_SETTINGS` and `WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS` permissions are optional if you do not need to edit any items.\n\n### Android 14 and Up\n\nThis app needs to target API 22 because API 23 (Android M) onwards do not allow it to modify some setting items without elevated permissions such as root or ADB.\nIn Android 14 onwards, a new restriction has been added that prevents an app targeting API 22 or earlier to be installed without elevated permission.\nYou can install the application from an ADB shell using the following command:\n\n```shell\nadb install --bypass-low-target-sdk-block SetEdit.apk\n```\n\nOr, from a rooted shell:\n\n```shell\npm install --bypass-low-target-sdk-block SetEdit.apk\n```\n\n(Replace `SetEdit.apk` with the actual file name or location.)\n\n### License\n\nGNU General Public License v3.0\n\n### Credits\n\n[SetEdit by 4A](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=by4a.setedit22)\n"

It enables an app to connect to the ADB daemon (`adbd` process) belonging to the same or a\ndifferent device and execute arbitrary services or commands (via `shell:` service).\n\n**Disclaimer:** This library has never gone through a security audit. Please, proceed with caution if security is\ncrucial for your app. Avoid using the APIs for reasons other than connecting or using ADB. For the safety of your app\nand its users, open a remote service instead of using ADB and ask the user to disconnect Wireless debugging.\n\n## Getting Started\n### Adding Dependencies\nLibADB Android is available via JitPack.\n\n```groovy\n// Top level build file\nrepositories {\n    mavenCentral()\n    maven { url \"https://jitpack.io\" }\n}\n\n// Add to dependencies section\ndependencies {\n    // Add this library\n    implementation 'com.github.MuntashirAkon:libadb-android:3.1.1'\n    \n    // Library to generate X509Certificate. You can also use BouncyCastle for\n    // this. See example for use-case.\n    // implementation 'com.github.MuntashirAkon:sun-security-android:1.1'\n\n    // Bypass hidden API if you want to use the Android default Conscrypt in\n    // Android 9 (Pie) or later. It also requires additional steps. See\n    // https://github.com/LSPosed/AndroidHiddenApiBypass to find out more about\n    // this.\n    // implementation 'org.lsposed.hiddenapibypass:hiddenapibypass:6.1'\n\n    // Use custom Conscrypt library. If you want to connect to a remote ADB\n    // daemon instead of the device the app is currently running or do not want\n    // to bypass hidden API, this is the recommended choice.\n    implementation 'org.conscrypt:conscrypt-android:2.5.3'\n}\n```\n\nIf you're using the custom Conscrypt library in order to connect to a remote ADB daemon and the app targets Android\nversion below 4.4, you have to extend `android.app.Application` to apply fixes for the random number generation:\n```java\npublic class MyAwesomeApp extends Application {\n    @Override\n    public void onCreate() {\n        super.onCreate();\n        // Fix random number generation in Android versions below 4.4.\n        PRNGFixes.apply();\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    protected void attachBaseContext(Context base) {\n        super.attachBaseContext(base);\n        // Uncomment the following line if you want to bypass hidden API as\n        // described above.\n        // if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.P) {\n        //     HiddenApiBypass.addHiddenApiExemptions(\"L\");\n        // }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Notice:** Conscrypt supports only API 9 (Gingerbread) or later, meaning you cannot use ADB pairing or any TLSv1.3\nfeatures in API less than 9. The corresponding methods are already annotated properly. So, you don't have to worry about\ncompatibility issues that may arise when your app's minimum SDK is set to one of the unsupported versions.\n\n### Configuring ADB\nInstead of doing everything manually, you can create a concrete implementation of the `AbsAdbConnectionManager` class. \nExample\n...
