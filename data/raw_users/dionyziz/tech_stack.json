      "README.md": "# Wave simulation in WebGL\nThis is a simple [WebGL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL) simulation of the 2D wave equation.\n\n**[Launch the simulation](https://dionyziz.com/graphics/wave-experiment/)**\n\n## Architecture\nThe root HTML file lies at index.html. This includes a basic CSS stylesheet, style.css, for elementary typography, as well as three Javascript files, three.js, TrackballControls.js, and main.js.\n\nWe use the de-facto standard [three.js](http://threejs.org/) WebGL Javascript library as our underlying framework for drawing 3D graphics. This provides basic rendering capabilities. We use the TrackballControls three.js plugin for elementary user interface controls which let the user rotate using drag and drop, zoom in and out using the mouse wheel, and panning using right-click drag and drop.\n\nWe use [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) for our implementation. We chose CoffeeScript for its elegance and simplicity.\n\nThe main script file which performs the simulation is main.coffee, which is compiled to Javascript as main.js.\n\n## How it works\nThe code consists of three portions, namely initialization, control handling, and integration. The core of the idea is implemented in the integration part.\n\nInitialization is realized in the `init` function. The `init` function begins by creating a standard three.js scene, including a camera, a light, a scene, and the geometry with its materials. The geometry consists of a supporting cube of which the top face is the geometry which we manipulate to generate waves. The top face of the cube is a plane parallel to the xz plane of width and height `W` and `H` respectively. It is subdivided into `N` subquads in each direction, each of whose vertices' position is later manipulated to render waves.\n\nInitialization has a sub-stage which introduces the initial condition of the world - a droplet at the center of the sea.\n\nControl handling is realized in the function `hitTest`. We use a [standard three.js hit testing method](http://mrdoob.github.io/three.js/examples/canvas_interactive_cubes.html). When the user clicks on the screen, we unproject the location of the mouse into the 3D scene and detect the point of the sea that was clicked. We then modify the current waves to accommodate for a new droplet in that location.\n\nThe core of the program lies at the function `animate` and `integrate`. The `animate` function is the main loop of the simulation. It requests a rendering of the current graphical scene from three.js and subsequently calls `integrate` as many times as required to perform the physical simulation. `integrate` is responsible for the physical aspect of the calculations. It goes through all the vertices of the sea and evaluates their new locations based on certain physical formulae.\n\nOur simulation is all performed at the CPU level. We are able to afford this, as our simulation algorithms are linear with respect to the number of vertices in question. If you want to run this simulation at higher sp\n... (truncated)"
