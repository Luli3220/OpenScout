Whereas PyGMTSAR processes single-polarization scenes and bursts along one orbital path, InSAR.dev separates the workflow into two phases: preparing SLC data (including geocoding, flat-earth and topographic correction, and packaging into cloud-ready bursts) and then performing the core interferometric analysis on those datasets. This design scales to hundreds or thousands of bursts across multiple polarizations and orbital paths.\n\nFor example, the following interactive notebooks demonstrate processing of 8 Sentinel-1 scenes (~1000 bursts) across 2 orbital paths and 2 polarizations (VH, VV):\n\n[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1KsHRDz1XVtDWAkJMXK0gdpMiEfHNvXB3?usp=sharing) InSAR.dev Sentinel-1 SLC Burst Preprocessing.\n\n[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/156Gvd-0C7DrXWDe1JCSxJyE-s1FyZeDl?usp=sharing) InSAR.dev Sentinel‑1 Multi‑Polarization and Multi‑Path Interferograms (adopted for slow 2 vCPU free Google Colab).\n\n[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1g_mZK6YZ614t45D1zKCO-U_X5E6hfknz?usp=sharing) InSAR.dev Sentinel‑1 Multi‑Polarization and Multi‑Path Interferograms on Google Colab Pro.\n\nThe InSAR.dev ecosystem comprises three Python packages. **insardev_toolkit** provides utility functions and helpers; **insardev_pygmtsar**handles Sentinel‑1 SLC preprocessing (requires GMTSAR binaries); and **insardev** performs core interferometric processing and analysis with no external dependencies. Both **insardev_toolkit** and **insardev_pygmtsar** are BSD‑licensed, while **insardev** may require a subscription for certain use cases.\n\nInSAR.dev documentation, use cases and project updates are available on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/pechnikov).\n\n\n## PyGMTSAR (Python InSAR): Powerful, Accessible Satellite Interferometry\n\n<img src=\"assets/logo.jpg\" width=\"15%\" />\n\nPyGMTSAR (Python InSAR) is designed for both occasional users and experts working with Sentinel-1 satellite interferometry.

By performance reasons in case when the geometry includes more than 1M points only bounding box will be saved.\n\n## N-Cube ParaView Plugin Sources:\n\n**N-Cube Image On Topography Source** - data source for georeferenced image. Optionally GeoTIFF or NetCDF topography (DEM) raster using to define Z coordinates. Optional \"Use Sea Level for Negative Topography\" parameter allows to replace negative topography values by zeroes.\n\n**N-Cube Reproject Filter** - TODO.\n\n**N-Cube Shapefile On Topography Block Source** - data source for 2D/3D Shapefile or GeoJSON. Optionally GeoTIFF or NetCDF topography (DEM) raster using to define Z coordinates. Optional \"Group by Field\" parameter produces a set of layers from geometries grouped by the field. When the \"Group by Field\" parameter is not defined (\"None\") all the geometries separated as the layers. All shapefile fields presented in the ouput.\n\n**N-Cube Table Block Source** - data source for CSV table data to produce geometries like to wells. \n\n**N-Cube Table on Topography Block Source** - data source for CSV table data to produce geometries on optional topography. See for details [NCubeTableOnTopographyBlockSource](https://github.com/mobigroup/ParaView-plugins/tree/master/NCube/NCubeTableOnTopographyBlockSource)\n\n**N-Cube Topography Block Source** - data source for GeoTIFF or NetCDF topography (DEM) raster visualization as 3D surface.

M. Marks, NOAA Laboratory for Satellite Altimetry, USA. See also more detailed explanation of the original approach in a paper \"Radially symmetric coherence between satellite gravity and multibeam bathymetry grids\" (Marks and Smith, 2012).\n\nFor details see LinkedIn pulications [Spectral Coherence between Gravity and Bathymetry Grids](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/computing-coherence-between-two-dimensional-gravity-grids-pechnikov/) and [The Density-Depth Model by Spectral Fractal Dimension Index](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/density-model-spectral-fractal-dimension-index-alexey-pechnikov/)\n\n<img src=\"Antarctica/Pearson%20Correlation%20Coefficient:%20GEBCO_2019%20vs%20Sandwell%20and%20Smith%20Gravity%20Anomaly.jpg\" width=400>\n\n## Spatial data processing in PostgreSQL/PostGIS\n\nUsually we use raster data processing which is fast and well-optimized due to a defined data grid.\nNevertheless, there are lots of cases when we require for sparse/irregular/multi-scale data processing.\nIt can be done different ways and the PostgreSQL/PostGIS engine for data processing is powerful and helpful.\n\n * [Spheroid](Spheroid) based spatial data processing for irregular data.\n Here Radon Transform creates bins by radial distance from point and calculate average values for the bins and Gaussian Transform\n calculates transformation weights by distance on sphere (or ellipsoid). That's slow relative to regular grid processing but\n allow high accuracy processing on sparse data.\n\n<img src=\"Spheroid/Gaussian%20Filtering%20on%20Spheroid%20%5BGlobal%5D.jpg\" width=400>\n\n<img src=\"Spheroid/Radon%20Transformation%20on%20Spheroid%20%5BGlobal%5D.jpg\" width=400>\n\n## Spatial spectrum processing of gravity, magnetic, DEM and satellite images\n\n * See [Super Resolution](Super%20Resolution) for gravity enhanced by DEM and [Elevation1 - Mashhad, Iran](Elevation1 - Mashhad, Iran) for DEM enhanced by satellite/orthophoto image by spatial spectrum transfer technique.
