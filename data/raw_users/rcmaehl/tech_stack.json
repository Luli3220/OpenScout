Additionally, an Image File Execution Options mode is available to operate similarly to the Old EdgeDeflector. Additional modes are planned for future versions.\n\nNo Default App walkthrough or other steps, just set and forget.\n\n> :warning: PLEASE NOTE: MSEdgeRedirect is still BETA.

A lot of similar **snake oil marketed** Non-Free alternatives exist that like to call themselves names such as \"Game Booster\", \"FPS Booster\", \"System Stabilizer\", \"Process Tweaker\", \"Game Tweaker\" among other terms we don't like. We will not market ourselves as such. NotCPUCores does the same or similar tweaks compared to non-free alternatives as well as providing additional features.\n\n## Is it worth using NotCPUCores/CPUCores/(Insert Other Optimizer/Booster Here)?\n\nAll these \"optimizers\" do simple tweaks that you yourself can do, so probably not; You DEFINITELY should NOT be forced to pay money for it. You MAY see marginal returns, slightly better stability of FPS, but also more battery usage. There is SIMPLY NO REPLACEMENT for doing a hardware upgrade.\n\n## How does it work? / Getting the Benefits without Installing / Etc\n\nVisit the [Wiki](https://github.com/rcmaehl/NotCPUCores/wiki)\n\n## How to build from source code\n\n1. Download and run \"AutoIt Full Installation\" from [official website](https://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/downloads). \n1. Get the source code either by [downloading zip](https://github.com/rcmaehl/NotCPUCores/archive/master.zip) or do `git clone https://github.com/rcmaehl/NotCPUCores`.\n1. Right click on `NotCPUCores.au3` in the NotCPUCores directory and select \"Compile Script (x64) (or x86 if you have 32 bit Windows install).\n1. This will create NotCPUCores.exe in the same directory.\n\nThis program is free and open source. Feel free to download and modify. Please do not sell exact copies.\n"
