Consider making [a small donation](https://patreon.com/plexus).**\n\nChestnut is a Clojure/ClojureScript application template. It takes the pain out\nof getting a working ClojureScript setup with live reloading plus a browser\nconnected REPL.\n\nIt provides a solid default configuration for a REPL driven workflow, a\nClojureScript setup with separate dev/prod/test builds, Figwheel integration,\nand a basic setup for running CLJ and CLJS unit tests. It provides a basic web\nbackend setup with Compojure, and a frontend based on one of the React wrappers\n(your choice of Reagent, Rum, om-next, re-frame, or Vanilla JS). It works out of the\nbox on popular cloud providers like Heroku.\n\nWhile Chestnut it's quite \"complete\" in a sense, it also tries to be minimal.\nBoilerplate code is kept to a minimum, and there is only just enough structure\nto get you started. How you build and structure your app from there is up to\nyou.\n\nChestnut should appeal to beginners because it allows you to get started quickly\nand with minimal baggage, it should appeal to more seasoned developers because\nit provides all the \"obvious\" configuration for a comfortable setup, without\nbeing so opinionated that it becomes a straight jacket.\n\nFor deployment you get uberjar support, meaning you can get all your code\ncompiled, optimized, and packaged in a single executable JAR file. It also\ncontains the necessary artifacts to work on Heroku out of the box.\n\n**Need help?** Ask [on the mailing list](http://clojureverse.org/c/chestnut)\n(issues on GitHub are for bugs. Feature requests can be done either on the\nmailing list or on Github.)\n\nThis README may describe unreleased features.
