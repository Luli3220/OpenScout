Keep it old-school with modern build tools. This boilerplate setup makes it easier to write your own styling, scripts, and mark-up.\n\n## ✨ Features\n\n- Write SCSS and modern JavaScript code in `src` and build minified, transpiled code for production in `dist`\n- Continuous integration with linting tests and deploying to `gh-pages`\n- Live reloading with webpack-dev-server\n- ES6+ to ES5 transpilation, bundling, and minification\n- SCSS to CSS transpilation, bundling, autoprefixing, and minification\n- Automatic copying of HTML and static assets from `src` to `dist` folders\n- Linting for styles and scripts\n\n## 🛠 Usage\n\n- Use this template on GitHub or download the latest release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/erickzhao/static-html-webpack-boilerplate/releases).\n- Write all your ES2015+ Javascript code in `src/js` and SCSS styling in `src/style`. Store static assets in `src/static`. Organize HTML files the way you like.\n- Available commands:\n  - `npm run build`: Build files to the `dist` folder. Transpiles down to ES5 and bundles all JS into `app.bundle.js`. Transpiles SCSS to CSS and adds prefixing into `style.bundle.css`. Copies static assets and HTML over, and bundled CSS and JS gets added to HTML file.\n  - `npm run start:dev`: Run `webpack-dev-server` at `localhost:9000`. Includes live reloading on any Javascript/SCSS/HTML changes.\n  - `npm run start`: Builds files and runs a local production server on `localhost:8080` with `http-server`.\n  - `npm run run lint:js`: Lints JS with ESLint.\n  - `npm run lint:styles`: Lints SCSS stylesheets with stylelint.\n  - `npm run lint:html`: Lints HTML for a11y issues using pa11y.\n  \n## 🔄 Continuous Integration\n\nThis boilerplate contains integration with [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/). The build system runs all linting scripts and deploys to GitHub pages upon push to the `master` branch. However, note that this deployment flow only works for Project Pages, as User and Organization pages [only support the master branch flow](https://help.github.com/art\n... (truncated)"

Configure the GitHub App.\n2. invite-contributors will automatically invite new users who have their pull requests merged to your organization.\n3. More options are available if you add a `.github/invite-contributors.yml` file into your repository such as below.\n\n```\n# If true, this will add new contributors as outside collaborators\n# to the repo their PR was merged in. Team name is ignored if this\n# flag is set to true.\nisOutside: false\n\n# Specify team name to add new contributors to a specific team\n# within your organization.\n# Use team name or team-name-slug\nteam: MY TEAM NAME\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nAnyone can contribute with [issues](https://github.com/erickzhao/invite-contributors/issues) and [PRs](https://github.com/erickzhao/invite-contributors/pulls). If you're submitting a pull request, always create a new branch to work your changes, and try squashing commits down if possible. Always test any new code and make sure `npm test` passes and code coverage is adequate before opening a PR.\n"

You have to count everything out individually.\n* Unary multiplication: taking a set A and a set B, their product B will be the substition of each element of set A by a set B'.\n\nUnary representation is quite inefficient. It works well for addition of small sets because it's easy to visualize, but once sets get too large, your representation will contain way too many characters.\n\nNumeral representations, such as the Roman numerals, came up with more efficient representations to describe larger numbers. However, since the largest character M only represents 1000, it is hard to represent numbers that are of orders of magnitude larger. Furthermore, the romans didn't even have a zero in their system, which means that addition was impossible. Adding 0 expanded how mathematics could work.\n\n#### Algorithm 1: Addition\n\nUsing a base-10 addition table:\n\n![Addition Table](http://i.imgur.com/BigcVCd.png)\n\n**Addition (base 10): Add two _N_ digit numbers _a_ and _b_ represented by an array of digits.**\n\n\tcarry = 0\n\tfor i = 0 to N-1 do \n\t\tr[i]  <-- R[a[i],b[i],carry] // only keeps track of the right-most digit of the sum.\n\t\tcarry <-- L[a[i],b[i],carry] // only keeps track of the left-most digit of the sum.\n\n\t\t/* \n\t\t\tNote that:\n\t\t\tR[a[i],b[i],carry] = (a[i]+b[i]+carry) % 10\n\t\t\tL[a[i],b[i],c\n...
