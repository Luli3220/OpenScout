The setup above might not be technically correct but\ndoes work.\nThe xr819 node should be self explanatory. The compatible string is used by the driver\nto find the node. The wake interrupt from the xr819 needs to be provided. \n\nFinally you can specify a MAC address to use. If you don't set one you will get a random one\non each boot. Instead of creating a new device tree file for every system you should\nprobably overwrite the address given after loading the device tree in u-boot. For the sunxi\nuboot all you have to actually do is add something like \"ethernet1 = &xr819wifi;\" to the\naliases section of the device tree you give to the kernel and u-boot will update the mac\n\n...
