This project tries to fill some of these gaps by providing a collection of libraries for various aspects of game development, from **GPU-driven particle systems and VFX**, to **game UI**, **editor tooling**, **camera rigs**, **audio**, **multi-device input**, and more.\n\n> **Note**\n> While this suite of libraries targets building games with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [React-Three-Fiber], some of them can also be used outside of React, just like some others are not specific to Three.js or React-Three-Fiber. But building games with React is where our hearts are at, which is why you will find most example code in this document to be written in React. 😎\n\n## Sponsors ❤️\n\nThis project wouldn't be possible without the support from its lovely [sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/hmans). If you'd like to sponsor this project and help **make game development with React & Three.js incredible**, [click here](https://github.com/sponsors/hmans)!\n\n<!-- sponsors --><!-- sponsors -->\n\n## Getting Started\n\n**Most of the packages in this repository are under heavy development**, and even though I regularly [push new bits to NPM](https://github.com/hmans/composer-suite/releases), expect much of it to be largely undocumented and unstable, particularly anything that has yet to reach version 1.0.0.\n\nIf you'd like to give this stuff a try today, the easiest way would be to either clone this repository to your local computer and run one of the many example apps (or the demo game, Space Rage; see below). Alternatively, you can also [open this repository on CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/p/github/hmans/composer-suite/main?file=%2FREADME.md) and play with the code there!\n\n## Space Rage\n\n![spacerage-banner](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1061/194765077-4e1e1086-6596-474a-aab0-aec9d92f8fbd.jpg)\n\nThe development of the Composer Suite is primarily driven by that of **Space Rage**, an open-source top-down twin-stick shooter game that is also intended to be a showcase for the libraries here.\n\n- **[Play Space Rage](https://spacerage2.vercel.app/)** (development build!)\n- [Play and edit Space Rage in CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/p/github/hmans/composer-suite/dev?selection=%5B%7B%22endColumn%22%3A31%2C%22endLineNumber%22%3A21%2C%22startColumn%22%3A31%2C%22startLineNumber%22%3A21%7D%5D&file=%2Fapps%2Fspacerage%2Fsrc%2FGame.tsx&workspace=%257B%2522activeFileId%2522%253A%2\n...
