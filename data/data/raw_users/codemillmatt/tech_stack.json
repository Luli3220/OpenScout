So you may want to delete the Codespace after you're finished with it depending on your plan.\n\n### Why MEAI\n\nThe Microsoft.Extensions.AI library provides a common set of abstractions over AI services. This means that no matter which service you're using - DeepSeek, OpenAI, Mistral - or where it's hosted - GH Models, Ollama, Azure AI Foundry - you get to the use the same API surface to interact with the model. This lowers the friction of getting started - you don't have to remember the particulars of many different libraries - just one, MEAI.\n\nAnd most functionality that you will use comes from the `IChatClient` interface. Since it is an interface, it needs to be instantiated as a concrete implementation - as that's the one thing that will be different based on the underlying AI Service.\n\nSo if you're using Ollama - you'll use the **Microsoft.Extensions.AI.Ollama** package to create the `IChatClient`. If you're using GitHub Models, it'll be **Microsoft.Extensions.AI.AzureAIInference**. But once you instantiate `IChatClient` - you're off to the races.\n\n### Running with GitHub Models\n\nGitHub Models are a great way to explore various AI models quickly. DeepSeek R1 is no exception and we can build an app quickly with MEAI.\n\nYou'll need a GitHub Personal Access Token to get started. You can follow the [steps here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic) ... OR ... just [run this repo in a Codespace](https://codespaces.new/codemillmatt/deepseek-dotnet) and it will take care of all that for you.\n\nIf you do run locally, make sure you setup a user secret in the **DeepSeek.Console.GHModels** project with the key name of `GITHUB_TOKEN` \n...

This repository backs up the [Xamarin 101 Tutorials](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Xamarin-101?WT.mc_id=mobile-0000-masoucou) that aired on Microsoft's Channel 9 during the summer of 2019. That's a long time ago you say? Don't worry - the concepts are still relevant.\n\nThis readme will walk you through  [Xamarin.Forms UI with XAML](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Xamarin-101/XamarinForms-UI-with-XAML-5-of-11?WT.mc_id=mobile-0000-masoucou), [Xamarin.Forms MVVM with XAML](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Xamarin-101/XamarinForms-Navigation-with-XAML-7-of-11?WT.mc_id=mobile-0000-masoucou), and [Xamarin.Forms Navigation with XAML](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Xamarin-101/XamarinForms-Navigation-with-XAML-7-of-11?WT.mc_id=mobile-0000-masoucou). These are episodes 5, 6, and 7.\n\nThere are more episodes in the series - a lot more. The first 4 are dedicated to explaining [what Xamarin is](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Xamarin-101/What-is-Xamarin-1-of-11?WT.mc_id=mobile-0000-masoucou) and how to [install it on a Mac](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Xamarin-101/Installing-Xamarin-on-a-Mac-3-of-11?WT.mc_id=mobile-0000-masoucou) and [PC](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Xamarin-101/Installing-Xamarin-on-a-PC-2-of-11?WT.mc_id=mobile-0000-masoucou). And finally a [basic Xamarin.Forms solution structure](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Xamarin-101/Xamarin-Solution-Architecture-4-of-11?WT.mc_id=mobile-0000-masoucou) that you'll see a lot.\n\nThere's really nothing to put in a readme about those, go watch the linked videos.\n\nEpisodes [8](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Xamarin-101/Single-Page-UI-in-C-8-of-11?WT.mc_id=mobile-0000-masoucou), [9](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Xamarin-101/XamarinForms-MVVM-in-C-9-of-11?WT.mc_id=mobile-0000-masoucou), and [10](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Xamarin-101/XamarinForms-Navigation-in-C-10-of-11?WT.mc_id=mobile-0000-masoucou) deal with the exact same concepts as 5, 6, and 7 - but instead of using XAML, they do it with C#.\n\nThis repo will cover XAML, as that's the most popular way of building Xamarin.Forms apps today.\n\n## The Episodes\n\n- [What is Xamarin](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Xamarin-101/What-is-Xamarin-1-of-11?WT.mc_id=mobile-0000-masoucou)?\n- [Installing Xamarin on a Mac](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Xamarin-101/Installing-Xamarin-on-a-Mac-3-of-11?WT.mc_id=mobile-0000-masoucou) or [Installing Xamarin on a PC](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Xamarin-101/Installing-Xamarin-on-a-PC-2-of-11?WT.mc_id=mobile-0000-masoucou)\n- [Xamarin Solution Architecture](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Xamarin-101/Xamarin-Solution-Architecture-4-of-11?WT.mc_id=mobile-0000-masoucou)\n- **IN THIS REPO!** [Building Up Xamarin.Forms UIs with XAML](xaml-ui)\n- **IN THIS REPO!** [Xamarin.Forms MVVM with XAML](xaml-mvvm)\n- **IN THIS REPO!** [Navigation in Xamarin.Forms with XAML](xaml-navigation)\n"

Use this repo to follow along with examples and hands-on practice as you learn about GitHub Copilot customizations.\n\n## Getting Started 🏎️\n\nThe easiest way is to run this in a devcontainer or a GitHub Codespace. It takes a bit to startup, but once it does, you'll be all set.\n\nOf course you can still run everything locally, but you'll want to have node, next.js and postgresql all installed.\n\n## What You'll Learn 📚\n\nThis repository covers three key areas of GitHub Copilot customization:\n\n### 🎯 Custom Instructions\n\nLearn how to create personalized instructions that guide Copilot's behavior across your entire development workflow. Custom instructions let you:\n\n- Set coding style preferences and conventions\n- Define project-specific context and requirements\n- Establish consistent patterns for code generation\n- Customize how Copilot interacts with your specific programming languages and frameworks\n\n### 💬 Reusable Prompts\n\nDiscover how to create and manage a library of reusable prompts for common tasks that you may ask the AI to do. This includes:\n\n- Checking on any pull requests you may have open\n- Define prompts for code reviews\n- Define instructions for generating commit messaes\n\n### 🤖 Custom Chat Modes\n\nExplore how to build specialized chat experiences tailored to your specific workflow needs. You'll learn to:\n\n- Create a chat mode for planning, where the AI has read-only access to the codebase and can only generate implementation plans.\n- Define a research chat mode where the AI can reach out to external resources.\n- Create a DBA chat mode where the AI knows in-depth details about your database and DB-related concepts.\n\n## A bit of a pre-req 🛠️\n\n### Using the GitHub MCP Server\n\nTo fully utilize the examples in this repository, you'll need to connect to the **GitHub MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server**. This remote server provides enhanced context about GitHub repositories, issues, pull requests, and collaboration workflows.\n\nThe GitHub MCP Server runs as a remote service and provides rich context about:\n\n- Repository structure and codebase information\n- Issue tracking and project management data\n- Pull request workflows and collaboration patterns\n- GitHub-specific development practices and conventions\n\nFor detailed setup instructions and configuration options, visit the official [GitHub MCP Server repository](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server).\n\n## Learn More 📖\n\nFor comprehensive information about GitHub Copilot customization features, check out the official [VS Code Copilot Customization Documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization). This resource provides in-depth guidance on:\n\n- Setting up custom instructions\n- Creating and managing reusable prom\n... (truncated)"
