      "README.md": "# In App Turbomodule\n\nThis is an example on how to create an In App Turbomodule (not an external library).\nTo create a Turbomodule in app, we roughly have to:\n\n1. Create the TS specs\n2. Configure codegen to run on the app\n3. Implement the Native Code\n4. Connect The TM with JS\n\n## 1. Create the TS Spec\n\n1. Create a folder called **specs** where we are going to write our Codegen Specs\n2. Create a file `NativeLocalStorage.ts` that will contain the spec for our module\n3. Add the specs for the `NativeLocalStorage` specs\n\n```ts\nimport { TurboModule, TurboModuleRegistry } from \"react-native\";\n\nexport interface Spec extends TurboModule {\n  setString(value: string, key: string): void;\n  getString(key: string): string;\n}\n\nexport default TurboModuleRegistry.get<Spec>(\"NativeLocalStorage\") as Spec | null;\n```\n\n> [!Note]\n> The spec file for Turbo Native Modules must have the prefix `Native` to work properly.\n\n## 2. Configure Codegen\n\n1. Open the `package.json` file\n2. Add the `codegenConfig` field as it follows\n\n```diff\n   \"packageManager\": \"yarn@3.6.4\",\n+   \"codegenConfig\": {\n+      \"name\": \"NativeLocalStorageSpec\",\n+      \"type\": \"modules\",\n+      \"jsSrcsDir\": \"specs\",\n+      \"android\": {\n+         \"javaPackageName\": \"com.nativelocalstorage\"\n+      }\n+   }\n}\n```\n\n## 3. Implement the Native Code\n\n### Android:\n\n1. In the folder path `android/app/src/main/java/com`, create a new folder `nativelocalstorage`\n2. Create a new file `NativeLocalStorageModule.kt`\n3. Modify the `NativeLocalStorageModule.kt` with the following code:\n```kt\npackage com.nativelocalstorage\n\nimport android.content.Context\nimport android.content.SharedPreferences\nimport com.nativelocalstorage.NativeLocalStorageSpec\nimport com.facebook.react.bridge.ReactApplicationContext\n\nclass NativeLocalStorageModule(reactContext: ReactApplicationContext) : NativeLocalStorageSpec(reactContext) {\n\n  override fun getName() = NAME\n\n  override fun setString(value: String, key: String) {\n    val sharedPref = getReactApplicationContext().getSharedPreferences(\"my_prefs\", Context.MODE_PRIVATE)\n    val editor = sharedPref.edit()\n    editor.putString(key, value)\n    editor.apply()\n  }\n\n  override fun getString(key: String): String {\n    val sharedPref = getReactApplicationContext().getSharedPreferences(\"my_prefs\", Context.MODE_PRIVATE)\n    val username = sharedPref.getString(key, \"\")\n    return username.toString()\n  }\n\n  companion object {\n    const val NAME = \"NativeLocalStorage\"\n  }\n}\n```\n4. In the same folder, create a new file `NativeLocalStoragePackage.kt`.\n5. Modify the new file with the following code:\n```kt\npackage com.nativelocalstorage;\n\nimport com.facebook.react.TurboReactPackage\nimport com.facebook.react.bridge.NativeModule\nimport com.facebook.react.bridge.ReactApplicationContext\nimport com.facebook.react.module.model.ReactModuleInfo\nimport com.facebook.react.module.model.ReactModuleInfoProvider\n\nclass NativeLocalStoragePackage : TurboReactPackage() {\n\n  override fun getModule(name: String, reactContext:\n...

      "README.md": "# Cocoapods Deprecation Exploration\n\nThis is an exploratory repository that contains various experiments I'm running to see what's the best path toward deprecating Cocoapods in React Native.\n\nThe exploration goal is to find a good alternative to fulfill the following requirements:\n1. Should allow users to build React Native from source.\n2. Should allow users to generate prebuilds for iOS. Prebuilds will be integrated n the final app using Swift Package Manager (SPM)\n3. Should allow us to remove responsibilities from Cocoapods.\n\nReact Native for iOS is currently built from source, using Cocoapods. Building rom source is an important feature that we want to preserve: it makes it easier to debug what's happening in React Native, it makes it easy to patch React native if needed, and it allows out-of-tree platforms (OOT) to build properly.\n\nOn the other side, it is really pointless to force millions of users to rebuild React Native locally every time. The majority of our users does not need to build React Native from source and we can save time and the environment if we can generate and distribute prebuilds for the default use case.\n\nFinally, Cocoapods is a dependency management system (DMS) which we use to configure the Xcode project and workspace to let `xcodebuild` build properly. cocoapods is written in Ruby and, over time, we abused of its flexibility. We now use Cocoapods to do much more than what they should do. For example, we use it to build Codegen, to run Codegen and to configure various flags. The final solution should **factor out** these behaviors that are independent from the DMS we decide to use. Factoring this out will make it easier to change and replace DMS in the future.\n\n## Exploration paths\n\nIn this Repository, we will explore various alternatives, and you can find a different folder for each alternative. Each folder has its own README.md with a description of the solution and some instructions on how to use it.\n\n- **Swift Package Manager (SPM)**: SPM is the DMS developed by Apple. It allows to describe the project using Swift in a declarative way. It can't be used to prepare app projects, but it supports libraries, which is what we need for React Native.\n- **Plain Xcode**: Xcode is the Apple IDE and it allow to configure complex projects if needed. We can try to set up a project in a way that consumes files from React Native as symlinks and use it to build from source and to prepare prebuilds.\n- **CMake**: Cmake is a tool that let users configure a project of any complexity. The tehnology that is then used to build the project is independent from Cmake, and we would like to use `xcodebuild`. Cmake is appealing as part of the Android build logic is already described by Cmake and we can share code between the platforms.\n\n## Other approaches\n\nThere are other approaches that we can explore, to achieve intermediate results.\nFor example, we can keep using Cocoapods to generate prebuilds. This can provide us more time to fid the best a\n... (truncated)"
