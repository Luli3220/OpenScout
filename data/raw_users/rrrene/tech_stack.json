[Fork it!](http://github.com/rrrene/credo/fork)\n2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)\n3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)\n4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)\n5. Create new Pull Request\n\n\n\n## Author\n\nRené Föhring (@rrrene)\n\n\n\n## License\n\nCredo is released under the MIT License.

One Inch at a time.\n\nTake a look at the [project page with screenshots (live and in full color)](http://rrrene.github.io/inch/).\n\n## What can it do?\n\n`inch` is a little bit like Code Climate, but for your inline code documentation (and not a webservice).\n\nIt is a command-line utility that suggests places in your codebase where documentation can be improved.\n\nIf there are no inline-docs yet, `inch` can tell you where to start.\n\n\n\n## Installation\n\nAdd this line to your application's Gemfile:\n\n    gem 'inch', require: false\n\nAnd then execute:\n\n    $ bundle\n\nOr install it yourself as:\n\n    $ gem install inch\n\n\n\n## Usage\n\nTo run Inch, simply type\n\n    $ inch\n\nGiven a `lib` directory with the following code inside:\n\n```ruby\nclass Foo\n  # A complicated method\n  def complicated(o, i, *args, &block)\n    # ... snip ...\n  end\n\n  # An example of a method that takes a parameter (+param1+)\n  # and does nothing.\n  #\n  # Returns nil\n  def nothing(param1)\n  end\n\n  def filename\n    \"#{self.class}_#{id}.foo\"\n  end\nend\n```\n\nInch will suggest that the docs could be improved:\n\n    # Properly documented, could be improved:\n\n    ┃  B  ↑  Foo#complicated\n\n    # Undocumented:\n\n    ┃  U  ↑  Foo\n    ┃  U  ↗  Foo#filename\n\n    You might want to look at these files:\n\n    ┃ lib/foo.rb\n\n    Grade distribution (undocumented, C, B, A):  █  ▁ ▄ ▄\n\n    Only considering priority objects: ↑ ↗ →  (use `--help` for options).\n\n\n\n## Configuration\n\nBy default, Inch looks into `{app,lib}/**/*.rb` for Ruby source files. You can customize this by either passing the desired files to the executable:\n\n    $ inch suggest plugins/**/*.rb\n\nor by creating a file named `.inch.yml` in your project directory:\n\n```yaml\nfiles:\n  # define files included in the analysis (defaults to [\"{app,lib}/**/*.rb\"])\n  included:\n    - plugins/**/*.rb\n  # define files excluded from the analysis (defaults to [])\n  excluded:\n    # you can use file paths\n    - plugins/vendor/sparkr/sparkr.rb\n    # or globs\n    - plugins/vendor/**/*.rb\n    # or regular expressions\n    - !ruby/regexp /vendor/\n```\n\nAs you would expect, `included` sets an array of included files (or globs) and `excluded` sets an array of files, globs or regexes of files to exclude from the evaluation.\n\n\n## Philosophy\n\nInch was created to help people document their code, therefore it may be more important to look at **what it does not** do than at what it does.\n\n* It does not aim for \"fully documented\" or \"100% documentation coverage\".\n* It does not tell you to document all your code (neither does it tell you not to).\n* It does not impose rules on how your documentation should look like.\n* It\n...

The overall principles are\n\n* be consistent in your choices (i.e. apply the same rules everywhere),\n* care about the readability of your code (e.g. when in doubt, spread text vertically rather than horizontally),\n* and care about easier maintenance (avoid confusing names, etc.).\n\nThis is especially important because we are such a young community. All the **code we put out there is worth its weight in gold** if it is easy to comprehend and invites people to learn and contribute.\n\n\n\n## Contribute\n\nIf you want to add to this document, please submit a pull request or open an issue to discuss specific points.\n\n\n## The Actual Guide\n\n### Code Readability\n\n* <a name=\"spaces-indentation\"></a>\n  Use tabs consistently (2 spaces soft-tabs are **preferred**).\n  <sup>[[link](#spaces-indentation)]</sup>\n\n* <a name=\"line-endings\"></a>\n  Use line-endings consistently (Unix-style line endings are **preferred**, but we should not exclude our brothers and sisters riding the Redmond dragon).\n  <sup>[[link](#line-endings)]</sup>\n\n* <a name=\"no-trailing-whitespace\"></a>\n  Don't leave trailing white-space at the end of a line.\n  <sup>[[link](#no-trailing-whitespace)]</sup>\n\n* <a name=\"newline-eof\"></a>\n  End each file with a newline (some editors [don't do this by default](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/no-newline-at-end-of-file)).\n  <sup>[[link](#newline-eof)]</sup>\n\n* <a name=\"spaces-operators\"></a>\n  Use spaces around operators and after commas.\n  <sup>[[link](#spaces-operators)]</sup>\n\n* <a name=\"spaces-braces\"></a>\n  Don't use spaces after `(`, `[`, and `{` or before `}`, `]`, and `)`. This is the **preferred** way, although other styles are possible, as long as they are applied consistently.\n  <sup>[[link](#spaces-braces)]</sup>\n\n  ```elixir\n  # preferred way\n  Helper.format({1, true, 2}, :my_atom)\n\n  # also okay - carefully choose a style and use it consistently\n  Helper.format( { 1, true, 2 }, \n...
