After all I am doing this for you as I really love teaching :).\n\nQuite often I receive questions on how to extend some solution\nfurther or fix some kind of an error. I'm trying to be as helpful as possible but please help me a bit as well. So, when sending\nme a question via e-mail or when reporting an issue here on GitHub:\n\n* Specify which article are we talking about.\n* If you need help with an error, *provide that error*! This seems obvious but sometimes people just forget to do so.\n* Error stack trace is always very much welcome.\n* If possible, list some pieces of relevant code or provide a link to the GitHub repo if your project is open source.\nIf, for some reason, you can't reveal your code (due to privacy policies, for example) - that's okay, we'll deal with this\nsomehow.\n* Try to overcome the problem yourself before contacting me and list the solutions you've already tried. Still, if you have\nabsolutely no clue of what to do - go ahead and write me right away.\n* If you are reporting an issue on GitHub, write in English because other people might experience the same problem. I am able to understand\nsome other languages (Russian, Ukrainian, Polish), well, at some basic level at least, but still English is preferred.\n* If you want me to cover a specific topic, try to provide some exact details on what has to be covered. Articles can't be too\nlong and therefore topics like \"how to write automated tests\" or \"how to write cool Rails apps\" aren't suitable. There are\nmany good books about Ruby and Rails in general out there :).\n\nThe more information you provide the faster we will be able to find a solution. Thank you for your understanding and\nplease don't hesitate to contact me :).\n\n## Legals\n\n(c) Ilya Bodrov ([bodrovis.tech](http://bodrovis.tech))\n\n\n\n"

It has been downloaded more than 10 million times and we're glad you guys found it useful. However, after discussing privately we've decided to put angular_rails_csrf under passive maintenance starting from June 2025.\n\nIn modern frontend–backend architectures (e.g., Angular, React, Vue + Rails APIs), CSRF protection is typically handled via token-based authentication (JWT, OAuth) and not via CSRF cookies. This gem remains relevant only for Rails monoliths that:\n\n- Use cookie-based session auth\n- Serve frontend via Rails\n- Expect `XSRF-TOKEN` / `X-XSRF-TOKEN` pattern\n\n---\n\nThe AngularJS [ng.$http](http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng.$http) service has built-in CSRF protection. By default, it looks for a cookie named `XSRF-TOKEN` and, if found, writes its value into an `X-XSRF-TOKEN` header, which the server compares with the CSRF token saved in the user's session.\n\nThis project adds direct support for this scheme to your Rails application without requiring any changes to your AngularJS application. It also doesn't require the use of `csrf_meta_tags` to write a CSRF token into your page markup, so it works for pure JSON API applications.\n\nNote that there is nothing AngularJS specific here, and this will work with any other front-end that implements the same scheme.\n\nCheck [version compatibility](https://github.com/bodrovis/angular_rails_csrf/wiki/Version-Compatibility) to learn which Rails/Rubies are currently supported.\n\n## Installation\n\nAdd this line to your application's *Gemfile*:\n\n```ruby\ngem 'angular_rails_csrf'\n```\n\nAnd then execute:\n\n```console\n$ bundle\n```\n\nThat's it!\n\n## Configuration\n\n### Cookie Name\n\nThe default cookie's name is `XSRF-TOKEN` but it can be configured with the `angular_rails_csrf_cookie_name` setting:\n\n```ruby\n# application.rb\nclass Application < Rails::Application\n  #...\n  config.angular_rails_csrf_cookie_name = 'CUSTOM_NAME'\nend\n```\n\n### Cookie Domain\n\nStarting from version 3, you may set domain for the XSRF cookie:\n\n```ruby\n# application.rb\nclass Application < Rails::Application\n  #...\n  config.angular_rails_csrf_domain = :all\nend\n```\n\nIf `angular_rails_csrf_domain` is not set, it defaults to `nil`.\n\n### Secure Cookie\n\nTo set a \"secure\" flag for the cookie, set the `angular_rails_csrf_secure` option to `true`:\n\n```ruby\n# application.rb\nclass Application < Rails::Application\n  #...\n  config.angular_rails_csrf_secure = true\nend\n```\n\n`angular_rails_csrf_secure` defaults to `false`.\n\n### SameSite\n\nThe SameSite attribute defaults to `:lax`. You can override this in the config:\n\n```ruby\n# application.rb\nclass Application < Rails::Application\n  #...\n  confi\n... (truncated)"

Check out [this sample app](https://github.com/bodrovis/jquery-slick-rails-demo/tree/master/Rails6Webpacker) for more info.\n\n## DEPRECATION NOTICE\n\nThis gem was created in 2014 and since then it has been downloaded more than 2 million times. I'm glad you guys found it useful! However, it's time to move on. Rails 6 uses Webpacker as a de-facto standard to bundle assets therefore **this gem became redundant for setups that utilize Webpacker or other bundlers like esbuild**. Moreover, Rails 7 is coming in December 2021 and this new version uses another modern approach: you can rely on [jsbundling-rails](https://github.com/rails/jsbundling-rails) and choose your favourite bundler (Webpacker, esbuild, rollup). Basically, it means that it's not recommended to install front-end packages as Ruby gems anymore.\n\nAnother thing to mention is that **Slick itself was abandoned** by its maintainer: there are no new releases since 2018. Slick was a great solution back in the day but now it was superseded by other modern libraries that do not rely on jQuery.\n\nTherefore, **jquery-slick-rails** is officially deprecated since December, 2021. **Version 1.10.0 is the final release** I'm going to roll out: it is tested with Rails 7 so it should still work fine with older setups. But once again: it's very much recommended to migrate to jsbundling-rails or Webpacker.\n\nThank you for your attention, and hopefully you'll find [my other solutions useful](https://rubygems.org/profiles/bodrovis).\n\n*Ilya Bodrov-Krukowski*\n\n## Installation\n\nAdd this line to your application's Gemfile:\n\n```ruby\ngem \"jquery-slick-rails\"\n```\n\nAnd then execute:\n\n```console\n$ bundle\n```\n\nOr install it yourself as:\n\n```console\n$ gem install jquery-slick-rails\n```\n\nNOTE: this is a jQuery plugin so you will also need the `jquery-rails` gem (it is not added by default starting from Rails 5.1):\n\n* https://github.com/rails/jquery-rails\n\n## Usage\n\nYou will need to add this line into your `application.js`:\n\n```javascript\n//= require jquery.slick\n```\n\nThen into `application.scss`:\n\n```scss\n@import 'slick';\n```\n\nor into `application.css`:\n\n```css\n/*\n*= require slick\n*/\n```\n\nStarting from version **1.4.0** Slick provides an optional theme, so if you want to employ default styling, include\nthe following line into `application.scss`:\n\n\n```scss\n@import 'slick-theme';\n```\n\nor into `application.css`:\n\n```css\n/*\n*= require slick-theme\n*/\n```\n\n### Demos\n\n[Check out this repo showing how to\n...
