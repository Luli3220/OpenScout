These two realities of distributed systems must be addressed to create a correct system, and often times the resulting systems have a high degree of complexity.  Because of this complexity, testing and verifying these systems is critically important.  In this talk we will discuss strategies for proving a system is correct, like formal methods, and less strenuous methods of testing which can help increase our confidence that our systems are doing the right thing.\n\n## References\n* [The Verification of a Distributed System](http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2889274)\n* Formal Specifications\n  * [Specifying Systems](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/tla/book-02-08-08.pdf)\n  * [Use of Formal Methods at Amazon Web Services](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/tla/formal-methods-amazon.pdf)\n  * [The Coq Proof Assistant](https://coq.inria.fr/)\n* [Simple Testing Can Prevent Most Critical Failures](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/osdi14/osdi14-paper-yuan.pdf)\n* Property Based Testing\n * [Haskell: Quick Check](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/QuickCheck)\n * [Erlang: Quick Check](http://www.quviq.com/products/erlang-quickcheck/)\n * [Other Quick Check Implementations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickCheck)\n * [ScalaCheck](https://www.scalacheck.org/)\n * [29 GIFs only ScalaCheck Witches will Understand](http://nerd.kelseyinnis.com/blog/2015/01/14/29-GIFs-only-scalacheck-witches-will-understand/)\n * [Quick Checking Riak](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/4505-quickchecking-riak)\n * [Testing Eventual Consistency in Riak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9mW54GJpG0)\n * [Combining Model Checking and Testing](http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/200544/main.pdf)\n * [Testing AUTOSTAR Software with QuickCheck](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?reload=true&tp=&arnumber=7107466&url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D7107466)\n * [Modeling Eventual Consistency Databases with QuickCheck](https://vimeo.com/23220830)\n * [The Mysteries of Dropbox](https://vimeo.com/158002499)\n* Fault Injection\n * [Jepsen](http://jepsen.io/)\n * [Netflix Simian Army](http://techblog.netflix.com/2011/07/netflix-simian-army.html)\n * Game Days\n    * [Resilienc\n...

However our applications do have state, \nwe just have moved all of it to caches and databases.  Today as applications are \nbecoming more data intensive and request latencies are expected to be incredibly \nlow, we’d like the benefits of stateful services, like data locality and sticky \nconsistency.  In this talk I will address the benefits of stateful services,\nhow to build them so that they scale, and discuss  distributed and scalable\nservices in the real world that implement these techniques successfully.\n\n## Resources\n* Consistency Models\n  * [Strong Consistency Models](https://aphyr.com/posts/313-strong-consistency-models) by Kyle Kingsbury\n  * [Types of Consistency](http://www.cs.colostate.edu/~cs551/CourseNotes/Consistency/TypesConsistency.html)\n  * [Consistency Diagram](http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol7/p181-bailis.pdf) by Peter Bailis et al\n  * [Eventual Consistency Revisited](http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2008/12/eventually_consistent.html) by Werner Vogels\n* Cluster Membership: Gossip Protocols \n  * [Gossip Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gossip_protocol)\n  * [Epidemeic Algorithms for Replicated Database Maintenance](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/49ed/15db181c74c7067ec01800fb5392411c868c.pdf)\n  * [Membership, Disemination and Population Protocols](https://qconnewyork.com/ny2016/ny2016/presentation/membership-dissemination-and-population-protocols.html) Video to Come\n* Work Distribution: Consistent Hashing & Distributed Hash Tables\n  * [Consistent hashing and random trees: Distributed caching protocols for relieving hot spots on the World Wide Web](https://www.akamai.com/es/es/multimedia/documents/technical-publication/consistent-hashing-and-random-trees-distributed-caching-protocols-for-relieving-hot-spots-on-the-world-wide-web-technical-publication.pdf)\n  * [Dynamo: Amazon's Highly Available Key Value Store](http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/files/amazon-dynamo-sosp2007.pdf) uses Consistent Hashing\n  * [Distributed Hash Table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table)\n* Real World Systems\n  * [Scuba: Diving into Data at Facebook](https://research.facebook.com/publications/scuba-diving-into-d\n...
