In the microservice world, your applications will probably talk to each other, as welll.\n\nThe last thing you want to happen is some other system's problem causing downtime in yours.\nWe're living in a world where [the network isn't reliable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_partition),\nand even healthy services can fail to respond to your requests due to network issues at any time.\n\nBy relying on systems living beyond your application's control, you reduce your [SLA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-level_agreement)\nto the lowest SLA of your dependencies. Even if your application has nine nines of availability (99.9999999%) on its own,\nbut it requires S3 (with uptime of 99.9%) to be up, your application is only available for 99.9% of the time.\n \nBecause of the risk associated with external services, modern applications employ a range of fault tolerance and isolation mechanisms,\nlike circuit breakers, rate limiters and bulkheads.\nTo ensure that our applications handle failure properly, and that we can react to problems in the system\nknowing what exactly doesn't work, we also track its health by\n[monitoring](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/best-practices/monitoring), tracing and other diagnostics.\n\nWe also use health checks.\n\n## Health checks\n\nThe health check pattern usually involves having an API endpoint that reports the health of your application,\nincluding the health of each external dependency. It's reasonable that the information the endpoint expo\n... (truncated)"

Released for Scala 2.12, 2.13 and Scala 3 (3.3.x and above).\n\n## Usage\n\nAdd the dependency. SBT:\n\n```sbt\n\"com.kubukoz\" %% \"slick-effect\" % \"0.6.0\",\n// for the LiftIO instance\n\"com.kubukoz\" %% \"slick-effect-catsio\" % \"0.6.0\"\n```\n\nAmmonite:\n\n```\n$ivy.`com.kubukoz::slick-effect:0.6.0`\n```\n\nCoursier / Scala CLI:\n\n```\ncom.kubukoz::slick-effect:0.6.0\n```\n\n### Instances\n\nImport the instances:\n\n```scala\nimport slickeffect.implicits._\n\n//an implicit EC is needed for cpu-bound work on DBIOs (map, flatMap)\nimport scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global\n\n//the instances will be in implicit scope\nscala> Sync[slick.dbio.DBIO]\nres0: Sync[slick.dbio.package.DBIO] = slickeffect.DBIOSync@434c179e\n```\n\n### Cats Effect 1.x/2.x -> 3.x migration guide\n\nCats Effect 3 changes the hierarchy of the type classes that are available, in a way that only lets us implement `Sync` and `LiftIO`. This means we're losing the old `Async`.\n\nTo work around that limitation and ensure you can still combine `Async` with `DBIO` _somehow_, you can do one of these two things:\n\n- Given an `Async[F]` for some `F[_]` (like `IO`), use `slickeffect.liftEffectToDBIO` to get a `Resource[F, F ~> DBIO]`, which you can `.use` and pass the value inside it whenever you need a conversion\n- Use `LiftIO[DBIO]` from the new `catsio` module, which serves as a `IO ~> DBIO` without a resource. This one requires an `IORuntime`, a non-implicit one is provided inside `IOApp`, so you can pass that when defining this instance.\n\nThese should be useful to anyone who was using `Async[DBIO]` previously - for example, if you were instantiating a Tagless Final algebra that required `Async`:\n\n```scala\ntrait Client[F[_]] {\n  def call: F[Unit]\n}\n\ndef asyncClient[F[_]: Async]: Client[F] = ...\n```\n\n**It is now impossible to directly get a `Client[DBIO]`, because of the `Async` constraint**. However, it is still possible to get to that instance through `IO` or any other type that you have a `~> DBIO` for:\n\n```scala\nval ioClient: Client[IO] = asyncClient[IO]\n\nimplicit val clientFunctorK: FunctorK[Client] = Derive.functorK\n\nval dbioClient: Client[DBIO] = ioClient.mapK(slickeffect.liftToDBIO[IO])\n```\n\n`FunctorK` and `Derive` come from [cats-tagless](https://github.com/typelevel/cats-tagless) (`Derive.functorK` is a macro from the `macros` module).\nA manually written instance of `FunctorK` would also work (these are usually trivial to write). For more complicated interfaces,\nsuch as ones that have methods taking `F[_]`-shaped arguments, check out ot\n... (truncated)"
