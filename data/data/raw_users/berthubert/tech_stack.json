      "README.md": "# googerteller\n\nAudible feedback on just how much your browsing feeds into Google.\n\nBy bert@hubertnet.nl / https://berthub.eu/ \n\nMakes a little bit of noise any time your computer sends a packet to a\ntracker or a Google service, which excludes Google Cloud users.\n\nDemo video [in this tweet](https://twitter.com/bert_hu_bert/status/1561466204602220544)\n\n[Blog post with more videos](https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/tracker-beeper/)\n\n## Installing on OSX:\nIf need be, install Homebrew via https://brew.sh/ as this will allow you to\ncompile new software. To do so, copy paste the instruction under 'Install\nHomebrew' into the terminal app ([Apple\nhelp](https://support.apple.com/guide/terminal/open-or-quit-terminal-apd5265185d-f365-44cb-8b09-71a064a42125/mac)). This might take quite a while.\nIt will also ask for your password.\n\nThen run:\n```\nbrew tap robertjakub/teller\nbrew install --HEAD googerteller\n```\n\nTo then start the noise, enter:\n```\nsudo tcpdump -nql | teller\n```\nAnd it should work. For the last command, it may also again ask you to enter your\npassword.\n\n## How to compile\nThis will currently only work on Unix derived systems (like Linux, OSX and\nFreeBSD). \n\nYou need a C++ compiler like `gcc-c++` and CMake for compiling the binary.\n\nYou also need to install `libpcaudio` (`libpcaudio-dev` on Debian/Ubuntu, `pcaudiolib-devel` on Fedora/Red Hat).\nFor OSX [this is a bit more work](https://github.com/espeak-ng/pcaudiolib#mac-os)\n\nThen do:\n\n```\ncmake .\nmake\n```\n\n## How to run\nStart as:\n```\nsudo tcpdump -nql | ./teller\n```\n\nAnd cry.\n\n## Configuration\nTracker data is read from `tracker.conf` which you should only edit if\nyou've learned about more IP addresses for relevant trackers.\n\nIn `teller.conf` you can edit for each tracker where the noise should end up\n(left or right channel), and what the frequency should be. \n\n## Data source\nThe list of Google services IP addresses can be found on [this Google\nsupport page](https://support.google.com/a/answer/10026322?hl=en).\n\nNote that this splits out Google services and Google cloud user IP\naddresses. However, it appears the Google services set includes the cloud IP\naddresses, so you must check both sets before determining something is in\nfact a Google service and not a Google customer.\n\n# To run on a single process on Linux\nOr, to track a single process, fe `firefox`, start it and run:\n\n```shell\nsudo bpftrace netsendmsg.bt |\n    grep --line-buffered ^$(pgrep firefox) | ./teller\n```\n\nOr try:\n\n```shell\nsudo bpftrace netsendmsg.bt | grep --line-buffered -i chrome | ./teller\n```\n\nAnd cry.\n\n## Dependencies\nThis software gratefully builds on:\n\n * [doctest](https://github.com/doctest/doctest) testing framework\n * [lpm](https://github.com/rmind/liblpm) Longest Prefix Match library\n * [Portable C Audio Library 1.2](https://github.com/espeak-ng/pcaudiolib) - which you need to install yourself\n * tcpdump of course\n"

Navilock NL-8012U receiver works really well, as does the U-blox\nevaluation kit for the 8MT.  In addition, many stations have reported\nsuccess with this very cheap [AliExpress sourced\ndevice](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32816656706.html).  \n\nFor ublox, there is good support for the F9P, several of us use the\n[ArdusimpleRTK2B](https://www.ardusimple.com/simplertk2b/) board. It adds\nthe Galileo E5b band.\n\nSeptentrio devices support even more bands.\n\nAn annotated presentation about our project aimed at GNSS professionals can\nbe found [here](https://berthub.eu/galileo/The%20galmon.eu%20project.pdf). \n\n> NOTE: One of our programs is called 'ubxtool'. Sadly, we did not do our\n> research, and there is another '[ubxtool](https://gpsd.io/ubxtool.html)' already, part of\n> [gpsd](https://gpsd.io). You might have ended up on our page by mistake.\n> Sorry!\n\nTo deliver data to the project, please read\n[The Galmon GNSS Monitoring Project](https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/galmon-project/)\nand consult the rules outlined in [the operator\nguidelines](https://github.com/berthubert/galmon/blob/master/Operator.md).\n\nHighlights\n----------\n\n * Support for Septentrio and U-blox.\n * Processes raw frames/strings/words from GPS, GLONASS, BeiDou and Galileo\n * All-band support (E1, E5a, E5b, B1I, B2I, Glonass L1, Glonass L2, GPS L1C/A)\n   so far.\n * Calculate ephemeris positions\n * Comparison of ephemerides to independent SP3 data to determine SISE\n   * Globally, locally, worst user location\n * Record discontinuities between subsequent ephemerides (in time and space)\n * Compare doppler shift as reported by receiver with that expected from ephemeris\n * Track atomic clock & report jumps\n * Coverage maps (number of satellites >5, >10, >20 elevation)\n * HDOP/VDOP/PDOP maps\n * Compare orbit to TLE, match up to best matching satellite\n * Tear out every bit that tells us how well an SV is doing\n * Full almanac processing to see what _should_ be transmitting\n * Distributed receivers, combined into a single source of all messages\n * Ready to detect/report spoofing/jamming\n\nData is made available as JSON, as a user-friendly website and as a\ntime-series database. This time-series database is easily mated to the\nindustry standard Matplotlib/Pandas/Jupyter combination (details \n[here](https://github.com/berthubert/galmon/blob/master/influxdb.md).\n\nThere is also tooling to extract raw frames/strings/words from specific\ntimeframes.\n\nGoals:\n\n1) Support multiple wildly distributed receivers\n2) Combine these into a forensic archive of all Galileo/GPS NAV messages\n3) Make this archive available, offline and as a stream\n4) Consume this stream and turn it into an attractive live website\n   (https://galmon.eu/).

We\nshould all be very grateful that BioNTech has shared this data with us.  And\nof course we should also be grateful to the many many researchers that\nworked for decades to bring the state of the art to the point that such a\nvaccine could be developed.  It is marvelous.\n\nThis GitHub repository is a companion to [Reverse Engineering the source code of the BioNTech/Pfizer SARS-CoV-2\nVaccine](https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/reverse-engineering-source-code-of-the-biontech-pfizer-vaccine/)\nand [part\n2](https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/part-2-reverse-engineering-source-code-of-the-biontech-pfizer-vaccine/).\n\nIn part 2 we find the challenge: Can we find an algorithm that turns the\nviral RNA into the vaccine RNA?\n\nIf so that would help explain how the vaccine is designed. It would also be\nuseful for other researchers to turn viral RNA into RNA that gets converted\ninto proteins efficiently.  \n\nDetails are in [part 2](https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/part-2-reverse-engineering-source-code-of-the-biontech-pfizer-vaccine/).\n\nData files\n----------\n\n * [ncov-s.fasta](ncov-s.fasta): the unprocessed RNA of the virus S protein\n * [vaccine-s.fasta](ncov-s.fasta): the unprocessed RNA of the vaccine S protein\n * [side-by-side.csv](side-by-side.csv): the two files aligned, with virual and vaccine codons side by side \n\n\n\n"
