Mathematical Notation is too information dense and often repeats itself. Perplexity 😵 is created specifically to model Neural Networks and cuts a lot of corners by specializing itself for this use-case.\n\n# Checklist for Documenting a Model\n\n1. How many languages/algebras are you going to use in documentation?\n> This determines the rank of your model. It is recommended to use different colored lines and circles\n> when swapping between languages.\n> For example, if you just want to document a TensorFlow model, then you only need Python and your model's rank will be 1.\n\n2. What prelude do you want to use?\n> A prelude will include some terms that you then don't need to define again yourself. Each prelude defines its own ranks, kinds, types, values etc. Please consider using a prelude.\n\n# List of Preludes\nPreludes are optional-ish.\n- [Categorical Prelude](/categorical_prelude.md)\n- [TensorFlow Prelude](/tensorflow_prelude.md)\n"
