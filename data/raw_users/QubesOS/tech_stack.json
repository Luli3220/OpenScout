It includes the following:\n\n * Qubes PGP keys (`keys/`)\n * Qubes Security Bulletins (`QSBs/`)\n * Qubes warrant canaries (`canaries/`)\n * Qubes Bitcoin fund information (`fund/`)\n * Qubes ISO digests (`digests/`)\n\nThe files contained in this repository can be verified in two ways:\n\n * By verifying the git commit tags (`git tag -v`)\n * By verifying the detached PGP signatures, which are provided for the majority\n   of files included here (e.g. individual QSBs, canaries, and other\n   announcements)\n\nAll the keys used by the Qubes OS Project, including the keys used to\nsign files and commits in this repository, are signed by the Qubes Master\nSigning Key. Even though this key is also included in this repo, you should\nmake sure to obtain the master key fingerprint via some other\nchannel, as you can be sure that if you were getting a falsified Qubes\nSecurity Pack it would contain a falsified master key as well.\n\nFor more information about the Qubes Security Pack, including its history and\nrationale, and for detailed instructions for verifying its contents, please see\nits [documentation page](https://www.qubes-os.org/security/pack/).\n\n"
