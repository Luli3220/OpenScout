I was able to test most and 75% of it works. If something does not work, please just submit an issue or pull request for it on the GitHub page. I will be making a more reinforced documentation for this whole API sometime in the future, but for now please just make use of the example.lua file for understanding it all. Thanks!\r\n\r\n## What is it?\r\nThis is essentially a Discord API for FiveM. It utilizes the REST API of Discord for all your essential needs :) Things that are heavy in Discord rate limiting (such as retreiving all server roles and player avatars) will be automatically stored to a cache for developers automatically. I will be moving all my scripts over to use this API for better ease of use. Some features include not having to gather role IDs at all, since the script gets the server's roles automatically, so you can just specify the role's name instead of role IDs at all (however, be aware that this will break then if someone changes the roles' names on Discord)... I hope you can all find some use for this, I know I will :P\r\n\r\n## Scripts that utilize the API\r\nhttps://forum.cfx.re/t/release-badgertools-major-revamp/665756/\r\nhttps://forum.cfx.re/t/discordaceperms-release/573044\r\nhttps://forum.cfx.re/t/release-bad-discordqueue-a-discord-role-based-queue-system-by-badger/1394685\r\nhttps://forum.cfx.re/t/discordtagids-i-know-i-know-i-only-make-discord-based-scripts/582513\r\nhttps://forum.cfx.re/t/discordchatroles-release/566338\r\n\r\n## Example Usage:\r\n\r\n```\r\n-- IMPORTANT:\r\n-- For use in other resources, you will need to use: \r\n--     exports.Badger_Discord_API:<function>\r\n--\r\n-- For example:\r\n--\t\texports\n...

However, one of the caught players when this happens should be the confirmed modder, but it is up to your discretion to figure out who. As a good train of thought, it's usually the user who is not in your discord or has a low playtime on your server.)\n\n## Summary\n\nBadger-Anticheat can catch modders noclipping, spectating, and even faking chat messages. Badger-Anticheat also will stop the spawning of peds from modders. Don't worry! AI are safe, but Badger-Anticheat just prevents the peds modders spawn from being spawned. Badger-Anticheat also stops blacklisted props from being spawned via the `Config` blacklisted list. If Badger-Anticheat can successfully find the modder who spawned the prop, it then kicks them and logs this via a Discord webhook. The code is quite simple, yet effective. I saw there was no real good anticheats on the forums, so I thought I should put one together. Some of the code comes from other developers, therefore I made sure to credit them within the code too. DevLanceGood is one of these developers, as well as Bluethefurry. I have linked their GitHubs below.\n\nhttps://github.com/DevLanceGood\n\nhttps://github.com/Blumlaut\n\n## Commands\nCurrenty there are no commands for this anticheat :(\n\n## Screenshots\n\n#### NOTE: These are not actual modders. These are friends of mine who helped test out the anticheat. We used a server-sided resource that mimicked a mod menu in order to thoroughly test to get these results. Upon putting the anticheat on our server, we caught a modder within the first 5 minutes of testing. Ironically he tried spectating whilst we were testing it. He got banned shortly after... lol\n\n![Catching a modder noclipping](https://i.gyazo.com/d1907105b1d065d6ed878366b90620b0.png)\n\n![Catching a modder spectating](https://i.gyazo.com/19d929e023970ae53ad3e7c7246c71b0.png)\n\n![Catching a modder faking a chat message](https://i.gyazo.com/4a58604bcc0d72f378a5f4e42d9e65bf.png)\n\n## Permissions\n\n`Anticheat.Bypass` - bypasses the Anticheat checks. You MUST give this to Staff who have NoClip and Spectating powers.\n\n## Configuration\n\n```\nConfig = {\n    TowTruckDrivers = {'S_M_M_TRUCKER_01', 'MP_M_WAREMECH_01'},\n    NoClipTriggerCount = 3,\n    BlacklistedModels = {\n        \"rhino\",\n        \"stt_prop_stunt_track_uturn\",\n        \n...
