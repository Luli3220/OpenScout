Numerous fungibility improvements have been proposed; however none of them have addressed the privacy issues in full. ZeroLink is first to offer protections against all the different ways a user's privacy can be breached. Thus the scope of ZeroLink is not limited to a single transaction, but it extends to transaction chains and it addresses various network layer deanonymizations, however its scope is limited to Bitcoin's first layer. Even if an off-chain anonymity solution gets widely adopted, ultimately the entrance and exit transactions will always be settled on-chain. Therefore there will always be need for on-chain privacy.  \n  \nIdeal fungibility requires every Bitcoin transaction to be indistinguishable from each other, but it is an unrealistic goal. ZeroLink's objective is to break all links between separate sets of coins. ZeroLink presents a wallet privacy framework coupled with Chaumian CoinJoin, which was first [hinted by hashcoin in 2011](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=12751.msg315793#msg315793) and [described in more detail by killerstorm in 2013](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=150681.0). A mixing round runs within seconds, its anonymity set can go beyond a single CoinJoin transaction's if needed, and its DoS resilience presumes a transaction fee environment above $1 Bitcoin.  \n  \nHopefully, ZeroLink will enable the usage of Bitcoin in a fully anonymous way for the first time.  \n\n## Table Of Contents\n\nI.

Something big. Like a train, and all I want is to jump on board, but it's getting faster and faster and I'm terrified that I'm gonna miss it.  \nRyan, Halt and Catch Fire|\n\n[Programming motherfucker](http://programming-motherfucker.com/), [cowboy programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowboy_coding) are what developers naturally [choose](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4vXGJ19Izw) when they finally find the time to work on a hobby project that they are enthusiastic about. This of course if you are not the [very best](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGkcnUy3l-c) expert with lots of [stamina](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QueWMFokFRw) will probably lead you to unfinished projects and frustration. Sadly I was never able to fully get the hang of the today popular [agile methodologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development), no matter how much I tried. So I went back in time to university, where the infamous, traditional [Rational Unified Process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_Unified_Process) had been forced down our throats, way before we ever acquired any software development experience. Despite the bad timing, I liked it. This gave me the first insight to what is going on in an office. Several years ago this thread of thoughts led me to [Agile Unified Process](http://www.ambysoft.com/unifiedprocess/agileUP.html) (AUP) and started to use it in my solo projects.  \n\n|Tip|\n|---|\n|If nobody supervises you, you have to supervise yourself.|\n  \nTime flew, things changed, books were read, experience was gained and I found myself using a reduced, lean, flexible and completely raped version of AUP.  \nNow, the time has finally came to armor myself with a guide on this development process.  \n\n## Disclaimer:\nI am not an expert on the topic,\n...

Configure Tor properly.\n6. `dotnet test`\n\n## Configure Tor\n1. Download Tor Expert Bundle: https://www.torproject.org/download/download\n2. Download the torrc config file sample: https://github.com/nopara73/DotNetTor/blob/master/torrc\n3. Place torrc in the proper default location (depending on your OS) and edit it:\n  - Optionally uncomment and edit the SocksPort, if you don't uncomment it will default to 9050 port anyway\n  - The default ControlPort in the sample is 9051, optionally edit it.\n  - Modify the password hash\n    - To run my tests, for the `ControlPortPassword = \"ILoveBitcoin21\"` the hash should be: `HashedControlPassword 16:0978DBAF70EEB5C46063F3F6FD8CBC7A86DF70D2206916C1E2AE29EAF6`\n    - For your application you should use different one, a more complicated one. Then start tor like this: `tor --hash-password password`\n      where password is the `password` you've chosen. It will give you the `HashedControlPassword`.\n4. Start tor, it will listen to the ports you set in the config file.\n\n## Usage\n\n```cs\nvar requestUri = \"http://icanhazip.com/\";\n\n// 1. Get real IP\nusing (var httpClient = new HttpClient())\n{\n\tvar message = httpClient.GetAsync(requestUri).Result;\n\tvar content = message.Content.ReadAsStringAsync().Result;\n\tConsole.WriteLine($\"Your real IP: \\t\\t{content}\");\n}\n\n// 2. Get Tor IP\nusing (var httpClient = new HttpClient(new SocksPortHandler(\"127.0.0.1\", socksPort: 9050)))\n{\n\tvar message = httpClient.GetAsync(requestUri).Result;\n\tvar content = message.Content.ReadAsStringAsync().Result;\n\tConsole.WriteLine($\"Your Tor IP: \\t\\t{content}\");\n\n\t// 3. Change Tor IP\n\tvar controlPortClient = new ControlPort.Client(\"127.0.0.1\", controlPort: 9051, password: \"ILoveBitcoin21\");\n\tcontrolPortClient.ChangeCircuitAsync().Wait();\n\n\t// 4. Get changed Tor IP\n\tmessage = httpClient.GetAsync(requestUri).Result;\n\tcontent = message.Content.ReadAsStringAsync().Result;\n\tConsole.WriteLine($\"Your other Tor IP: \\t{content}\");\n}\n```\n\n## Acknowledgement\nOriginally the SocksPort part of this project was a leaned down, modified and .NET Core ported version of the [SocketToMe](https://github.com/joelverhagen/SocketToMe) project.  \nOriginally the ControlPort part of this project was a leaned down, modified and .NET Core ported versi\n...
