      "README.md": "# React Native Bootcamp — A Curriculum for Beginners\n\n> A series of **React Native coding challenges** with a variety of difficulties for busy developers.\n\nI do `react-native` as a freelance since 2017 and I have 15+ years of experience shipping products with `JavaScript`. This bootcamp encapsulates all the problems I encounter in my daily job and all the things I wish I knew **before** starting my career as a React Native Developer.\n\nMy project-based pedagogy allows you to learn while building, a proven way for new skills to 'stick'.\n\n📱 Hearty thanks to the [team behind expo](https://expo.dev/), the open-source platform for making universal native apps with React that run on Android, iOS, and the web.\n\n🎨 Thanks as well to all the `react-native-paper` contributors for their easy to use UI library.\n\n🙏 Special thanks to [Alex Lobera](https://github.com/alexlbr), [Horacio Herrera](https://twitter.com/hhg2288), [William Candillon](https://github.com/wcandillon), [Satyajit Sahoo](https://github.com/satya164), [Tanner Linsley](https://github.com/tannerlinsley), [Brent Vatne](https://github.com/brentvatne).\n\n---\n\n## Getting Started\n\n**Students**, to follow this bootcamp, you need to **[complete the onboarding form](https://davidl.fr/bootcamp)**.\n\nChallenge after challenge, you are going to build this mobile appliction to buy Star Wars space ships using `TypeScript`, `expo`, `react-native` and `react-query`.\n\n> To support my work, I recommend downloading my [React Native Book about the ecosystem](https://gum.co/road-react-native).\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/flexbox/react-native-bootcamp/raw/main/hackathon/spacecraft/spacecraft-preview.gif\" width=\"50%\" height=\"50%\" />\n\n## Pedagogy\n\nI have chosen two pedagogical tenets while building this curriculum: ensuring that it is hands-on **project-based**, with **up-to-date dependencies** and that it **includes frequent quizzes**. In addition, this curriculum has a common theme —create a mobile app with real API— to give it cohesion.\n\n> If you encounter an issue, [feel free to contribute](https://github.com/flexbox/react-native-workshop/issues/new), I welcome your constructive feedback!\n\n## Each lesson includes\n\n- lecture\n- written lesson\n- step-by-step guides\n- a challenge\n- bonus challenges\n\n## Projects\n\nA list of projects done during the hackathon day:\n\n1. [spacecraft](./hackathon/spacecraft/) _with `react-query`_\n1. [newsfeed](./hackathon/newsfeed/) _with getstream API_\n1. [jimmy-punchline](./hackathon/jimmy-punchline/) _with genius API_\n1. [nerd-fm](./hackathon/nerd-fm/) _with `expo-av` to play music_\n1. [and more](./hackathon/)\n\n## Community\n\n💬 Join us on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/infiniteredcommunity/shared_invite/zt-1f137np4h-zPTq_CbaRFUOR_glUFs2UA) to discuss.\n\n⭐️ Help us out by [starring on GitHub](https://github.com/flexbox/react-native-bootcamp), filing bug reports in [issues](https://github.com/flexbox/react-native-bootcamp/issues) with questions or proposals.\n\n👥 Follow `flexbox_` on [Twitter\n...
