      "README.md": "sysadmin-utils\n============\n\nThis repository contains a small collection of scripts that might be\nuseful to sysadmins.  I put it together myself to centralise the small\ntools that I find useful, and it seems to be popular.\n\nI used to solicit the inclusion of new tools, but have slowly come\nto realize that \"less is more\".  I __love__ the idea of sysadmins,\ndevelopers, and other people building up their own toolkits, but also\nfind that people submit things that I just don't understand the appeal of.\n\nIt makes sense that personal-tools are very personal, but it does mean\nrejection is almost always the default behaviour and that makes me feel\nbad.\n\nInstead of adding things here consider this repository a small collection of things that I use, and if you want to take some/all of utilities into your own use then please do so.  If not then I would __strongly__ encourage you to consider what tools would make your daily-life more useful and then collect them, __document__ them, and publish them yourself.\n\n\nIn short the value here is the __idea__ of collecting your commonmost utilities and making them easy to install and update from one central-source.  Not the specific tools themselves.\n\nThere is a replacement repository which is still open, and which new additions can be made more freely:\n\n* https://github.com/skx/sysbox\n\n\n\nago\n---\n\nShow how long ago a file/directory was modified in a  human-readable fashion.\n\nExample:\n\n     $ ./ago /etc/passwd\n     /etc/passwd 15 weeks ago\n\nAlternatives:\n\n* `stat` and `ls` both show ages, but not in a human-readable fashion.\n\n\n\nchronic\n-------\n\nRun a command, hiding STDOUT and STDERR if it completes successfully.\n\nExample:\n\n     ./chronic cp /etc/passwd /tmp/not/found\n\nThis is designed to be used for cron-jobs, where output is generally\nignored in the case of success.\n\nThis was written by Joey Hess and is part of [moreutils](https://joeyh.name/code/moreutils/).\n\n\n\ncidr2ip\n-------\n\nGiven a set of CIDR ranges output the individual IPs in the range(s).\n\nExample:\n\n     $ ./cidr2ip 192.168.0.0/24\n     192.168.0.0\n     192.168.0.1\n     192.168.0.2\n     192.168.0.3\n     192.168.0.4\n     ..\n\n\n\n\ncollapse\n--------\n\nRemove extraneous whitespace from lines, and remove empty-lines entirely.\n\nExample:\n\n     $ echo -e \"Test1\\n    f  \\n\\nTest2\\n\\n\\n\\n\" | ./collapse\n     Test1\n     f\n     Test2\n\nAlternatives:\n\n* `tr`\n* ...\n\n\n\ndupes\n-----\n\nReport on duplicate files, via a SHA1 hash of the contents, recursively.\n\nExample:\n\n    $ dupes\n    ./.git/logs/HEAD\n\t./.git/logs/refs/heads/master\n    ./.git/refs/heads/master\n\t./.git/refs/remotes/origin/master\n\nAlternatives:\n\n* [fdupes](http://packages.debian.org/fdupes)\n* [fslint](http://packages.debian.org/fslint)\n* [duff](http://packages.debian.org/duff)\n* [rdfind](http://packages.debian.org/rdfind)\n\n\n\nempty-dir\n---------\n\nIndicate, via return code, whether a given directory is empty or not.\n\nExample:\n\n    if empty-dir /etc; then echo \"We're broken\" ; fi\n\n\n\nexpand-ipv6\n-----------\n\nExpand an abbre\n...

Currently this is __known to\nfail__ upon Chrome and Safari.\n\n\n\nRationale\n---------\n\nI didn't like any of the online bookmark-syncing plugins/addins/tools I tested.\n\nThe idea of hosting an online bookmark server is appealing, but using the\npower of `git` it seems that having a local bookmark file should be pretty robust:\n\n * New items are added, generally one per line.\n * Existing items can be edited to add new tags.\n * Merges should be painless.\n\nThe included javascript magic is present solely to make the bookmarks\nmanageable, in my private copy I have 400+ bookmarks and with the\ntagging support present here they will continue to work for me easily.\n\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nIf you wish to use this bookmarks script, and are happy for your bookmarks\nto be public, then just fork [this repository](https://github.com/skx/bookmarks.public) and you're done.\n\nIf you prefer to keep your bookmarks private, as I do, then you'll need to\nhost your repository somewhere private.\n\nTo get started you might wish to examine contributed importers found beneath the [importers directory](importers/), which might be of interest.\n\nFor advanced usage you can see:\n\n* [Adding/Editing bookmarks via your browser](Browser.md)\n\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nIf you wish to submit improvements to the javascript, or the CSS, then I welcome forks & pull requests.\n\n>**NOTE**: If you submit a change feel free to add a link to your homepage/blog/whatever as part of that.  The included bookmarks are only examples.\n\n\nSteve\n--\n"

It might come and go.  It is not secure.\n\nThere is a _basic_ GUI present to allow you to view status-codes, and the most recent few requests:\n\n![Screenshot](_media/gui1.png)\n\n\n## Overview\n\nAssuming you have a service running within your local network, perhaps a HTTP server you could access via http://localhost:8080/, you can expose that to the public-internet by running:\n\n    $ tunneller client -expose localhost:8080\n\nThis will show you initial page of the GUI, letting you know how you can access your resource externally:\n\n![Screenshot](_media/gui0.png)\n\nAs the name implies there is a central-host involved which is in charge of routing/proxying to your local network - in this case that central host is `tunnel.steve.fi` - the reason this project exists is not to host a general-purpose end-point, but instead to allow you to host your own.\n\nIn short this project is designed to be a __self-hosted__ alternative to software such as `ngrok`.\n\nSo remember:\n\n>**NOTE**: There is a public end-point I host, you __SHOULD NOT__ rely upon it.  You should configure your own server, and use it.\n\n\n\n## How it works\n\nWhen a client is launched it creates a connection to a message-bus running on the default remote end-point, `tunnel.steve.fi`, it keeps that connection alive waiting for instructions.\n\nWhen a request comes in for `foo.tunnel.steve.fi` the server will submit a command for the client to make the appropriate request by publishing a message upon the topic the client is listening to.  (Each client has a name, and listens to its own topic).\n\nIn short:\n\n* The server sends a \"Fetch this URL\" request to the client.\n* The client makes the request to fetch the URL\n  * This will succeed, because the client is running inside your network and can access localhost, and any other \"internal\" resources.\n* The response is sent back to the server.\n  * And from there it is ro\n...
