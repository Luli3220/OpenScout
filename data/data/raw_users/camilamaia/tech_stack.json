Do not rely on defaults from factories\n\n    * If a default value is changed, all tests that depend on it will break\n    * The setup of a test should contain all the logic to ensure it will always pass\n    * Explicit better than implicit\n\n1. Factories should contain only the required data\n\n    * If the field is nullable (null=True) the attribute should be under a trait \n    and not as a default value\n    * If we want to have explicitly the attribute, we can use MyFactory(with_myattr=True)\n    * When are we going to remember to test the case MyFactory(myattr=None)?\n    * We should not assume there is an author when DB actually allows to not have it.\n\n1. Build over create\n\n    * MyFactory.build(): creates a local object (memory)\n    * MyFactory.create(): creates a local object + stores it in the DB\n\n1. If FK is in the table: SubFactor\n\n   If FK is in the other table: RelatedFactory + trait\n\n\n    * SubFactory: builds/creates the SubFactory during the process of creation of the main factory\n    * RelatedFactory: builds/creates the RelatedFactory after creating the main factory\n\n1. Use fixtures to wrap factories to avoid duplication\n\n1. Avoid sharing factories or fixtures among different files\n\n1. get_or_create should be used only for unique keys\n"
