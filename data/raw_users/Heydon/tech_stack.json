      "README.md": "# ![Fukol Grid System](logo.png)\n\n**Fukol&trade;** is a lightweight, breakpoint free, completely responsive, element query driven\\*, progressive enhancement based CSS grid framework. It exists in this `README.md` file, in the section titled **The CSS** (below). It is **93 bytes** minified, fitting comfortably inside a tweet:\n\n<img src=\"tweet.png\" alt=\"Fukol minified and in a tweet\" width=\"450\" />\n\nJust edit the lines marked 'edit me!' to your requirements and write an HTML structure like the one illustrated in the section titled **The HTML** (also below).\n\n(\\* Not really, but kind of. See **3** under **Notes**, below.)\n\n## The CSS\n\n```css\n.fukol-grid {\n  display: flex; /* 1 */\n  flex-wrap: wrap; /* 2 */\n  margin: -0.5em; /* 5 (edit me!) */\n}\n\n.fukol-grid > * {\n  flex: 1 0 5em; /* 3 (edit me!) */\n  margin: 0.5em; /* 4 (edit me!) */\n}\n```\n\n## The HTML\n\n```html\n<div class=\"fukol\"> <!-- 6 -->\n  <ul class=\"fukol-grid\">\n    <li><!-- grid cell/item/child/whatever --></li>\n    <li><!-- grid cell/item/child/whatever --></li>\n    <li><!-- grid cell/item/child/whatever --></li>\n    <li><!-- grid cell/item/child/whatever --></li>\n    <li><!-- grid cell/item/child/whatever --></li>\n    <li><!-- grid cell/item/child/whatever --></li>\n    <li><!-- grid cell/item/child/whatever --></li>\n    <li><!-- grid cell/item/child/whatever --></li>\n  </ul>\n</div>\n```\n\n## Notes\n\n1. **Fukol&trade;** is a Flexbox based grid system. Even Opera Mini supports Flexbox. Older user agents that don't support Flexbox ignore the `display: flex` declaration, degrading to a single column layout. No harm done.\n2. This line determines how items are handled. The `wrap` value means items will start a new row if there's not enough room on the current one.\n3. This is the 'element query' part. Instead of setting an arbitrary number of columns and using breakpoints, we decide roughly how wide we want the item to be (`5em` in the example — the flex basis) and make sure items can grow to use the available space (`1`) but not shrink (`0`). So only change the `5em` value and leave `1 0` as it is.\n4. This is for gutters. A `0.5em` margin here means gutters of `1em` (the margins double up).\n5. This should always be a negative version of **4**. It compensates for the margins created by the items. It makes sure the outside of the `.fukol-grid` container remains flush horizontally and no additional margin is added to the vertical flow.\n6. The `class=\"fukol\"` container in the HTML snippet enables you to add positive margins around the grid — not possible with just `.fukol-grid` because this uses negative margins (see **5**). It also suppresses horizontal scrolling issues which occur under certain circumstances.\n\n## Demos\n\n### Here's a gif\n\n![Grid items as boxes, collapsing into fewer columns at smaller viewports automatically](fukol-demo.gif)\n\n### Play around on CodePen\n\n[codepen.io/heydon/pen/dpzwVd](http://codepen.io/heydon/pen/dpzwVd)\n\n## Items with different widths\n\nSometimes you want certain items t\n...

      "README.md": "# Principles Of Web Accessibility\n\n_A set of high-level guiding principles for approaching web accessibility._\n\n* [Perfection is the enemy](#perfection-is-the-enemy)\n* [By default or death](#by-default-or-death)\n* [Parity is paramount](#parity-is-paramount)\n* [Design for implementation](#design-for-implementation)\n* [Structure first](#structure-first)\n* [Use your words](#use-your-words)\n* [Tools are not identities](#tools-are-not-identities)\n* [Less is less](#less-is-less)\n* [Get paid](#get-paid)\n* [Fishing, not fish](#fishing-not-fish)\n* [No points for performance](#no-points-for-performance)\n* [Let evil rot](#let-evil-rot)\n\n## Perfection is the enemy\n\nNothing is—nor can be—100% accessible. Anyone who claims their offering is completely accessible is a liar, or they don’t understand accessibility, or both. Usually both. It’s okay to deliver inaccessible work, so long as it’s _more_ accessible. Do what you can within the constraints given. If the constraints are unreasonable, challenge those first. You may not feel confident you are always the best person available to work on accessibility. But you _are available_. Don’t leave the work to absent (and nonexistent) accessibility superheroes. \n\n## By default or death\n\nAccessibility fundamentally does not work as a plugin, add-on, or opt-in state. If an interface offers the option to _enable_ accessibility, it is inaccessible. A low-contrast switch that turns on high contrast? Game over. Categorically, accessibility overlay software does not and cannot work. Adding _accessibility stuff_ on top of _inaccessible stuff_ does not address what needs to be addressed. The specific features offered by such third-party interlopers are immaterial. Resist the ideology of _post hoc_ accessibility at all costs. A Minimum Viable Product (MVP) without accessibility is not—even minimally—viable. \n\n## Parity is paramount\n\nThe point is not to create a better experience, or even a good experience. It’s to ensure a _comparable_ experience between different people. Interfaces should not be challenging to some and not to others, but some interfaces are necessarily complex and some content is inherently esoteric. You do not get to choose who is interested in—or can cope with—what. If an image serves as a joke, the alternative text should not give the joke away or explain why it is funny. It should _tell the same joke by alternative means_. The joke may be offensive to some or inexplicable to others. These are shortcomings of _inclusivity_, not accessibility.\n\n## Design for implementation\n\nThey say form should follow function. But most organizations design first and develop second. The design phase consists of purely graphical ideation and leaves too many implementation questions unanswered. Consequently, developers are encouraged to prioritize visual approximation over usability. Drag-and-drop interfaces need to be operable by keyboard. This means buttons need to be provided. Those buttons will need to appear in the so-cal\n... (truncated)"
