The pairs of chapters in\neach section demonstrate different families of solution approaches. Each chapter\nstarts with a problem, gives an overview of the relevant theory, shows a\nsolution approach in R and in Python, and finally gives wider context by\nincluding a number of published references. This structure will allow for maximum\naccessibility, with minimal prerequisites in mathematics or programming as well\nas giving the right opportunities for a reader wanting to delve deeper in to a\nparticular topic.\n\nFeatures\n\n- An excellent resource for scholars of applied mathematics and operational\n  research, and indeed any academics who want to learn how to use open-source\n  software.\n- Offers more general and accessible treatment of the subject than other texts,\n  both in terms of programming language but also in terms of the subjects\n  considered.\n- The R and Python sections purposefully mirror each other so that a reader can\n  read only the section that interests them.\n- An accompanying open source repository with source files and further\n  examples.\n\n## List of chapters\n\n### Chapter 1: Introduction\n\nThis chapter aims to help a reader understand if this book is for them and what\nbackground they need to use it. It starts by answering the following questions:\n\n- Who is this book for?\n- What is meant by applied mathematics?\n- What is open source software?\n\nThe chapter structure of the book is then discussed, apart from the 1st chapter\nall chapters have a similar structure and then some discussion is given to how\nthe code is written and presented.\n\nThis chapter can be skipped if a reader is confident in their use of programming\nand wants to skip ahead to a specific problem.\n\n### Chapter 2: Markov chains\n\nThis chapter models a barber shop as a queueing system using a continuous time\nMarkov chain. The goal is to identify which particular reconfiguration of the\nbarber shop would be most beneficial to customers.\n\nA theoretic overview of concepts related to stationary distributions of\ncontinuous Markov chains is given before solutions approaches are given in both\nR and Python. This is done using Numpy in Python and expm in R for all the\nunderlying linear algebra.\n\n- [Jupyter notebook example](./examples/ipynb/02/main.ipynb)\n\n### Chapter 3: Discrete event simulation\n\nThis chapter models a bicycle repair shop as a network of two queueing\nprocesses. The goal is to identify the effect of two particular improvem\n... (truncated)"
