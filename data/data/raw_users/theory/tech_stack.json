      "README.md": "pgTAP 1.3.5\n===========\n\n[pgTAP](https://pgtap.org) is a unit testing framework for PostgreSQL written\nin PL/pgSQL and PL/SQL. It includes a comprehensive collection of\n[TAP](https://testanything.org)-emitting assertion functions, as well as the\nability to integrate with other TAP-emitting test frameworks. It can also be\nused in the xUnit testing style. For detailed documentation, see the\ndocumentation in `doc/pgtap.md` or\n[online](https://pgtap.org/documentation.html \"Complete pgTAP Documentation\").\n\n[![PGXN version](https://badge.fury.io/pg/pgtap.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/pg/pgtap)\n[![🐘 Postgres](https://github.com/theory/pgtap/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/theory/pgtap/actions/workflows/test.yml)\n\npgTAP must be installed on a host with PostgreSQL server running; it cannot\nbe installed remotely.\n\nTo build it, just do this:\n\n```sh\nmake\nmake install\nmake installcheck\n```\n\nIf you encounter an error such as:\n\n```\n\"Makefile\", line 8: Need an operator\n```\n\nYou need to use GNU make, which may well be installed on your system as\n`gmake`:\n\n```sh\ngmake\ngmake install\ngmake installcheck\n```\n\nIf you encounter an error such as:\n\n```\nmake: pg_config: Command not found\n```\nOr:\n\n```\nMakefile:52: *** pgTAP requires PostgreSQL 9.1 or later. This is .  Stop.\n```\n\nBe sure that you have `pg_config` installed and in your path. If you used a\npackage management system such as RPM to install PostgreSQL, be sure that the\n`-devel` package is also installed. If necessary tell the build process where\nto find it:\n\n```sh\nenv PG_CONFIG=/path/to/pg_config make && make install && make installcheck\n```\n\nAnd finally, if all that fails, copy the entire distribution directory to the\n`contrib/` subdirectory of the PostgreSQL source tree and try it there without\n`pg_config`:\n\n```sh\nenv NO_PGXS=1 make && make install && make installcheck\n```\n\nIf you encounter an error such as:\n\n```\nERROR:  must be owner of database regression\n```\n\nYou need to run the test suite using a super user, such as the default\n\"postgres\" super user:\n\n```\nmake installcheck PGUSER=postgres\n```\n\nIf you encounter an error such as:\n\n```\nERROR: Missing extensions required for testing: citext isn ltree\n```\n\nInstall the PostgreSQL\n[Additional Supplied Modules](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/contrib.html),\nwhich are required to run the tests. If you used a package management system\nsuch as RPM to install PostgreSQL, install the `-contrib` package.\n\nTo install the extension in a custom prefix on PostgreSQL 18 or later, pass\nthe `prefix` argument to `install` (but no other `make` targets):\n\n```sh\nmake install prefix=/usr/local/extras\n```\n\nThen ensure that the prefix is included in the following [`postgresql.conf`\nparameters]:\n\n```ini\nextension_control_path = '/usr/local/extras/postgresql/share:$system'\ndynamic_library_path   = '/usr/local/extras/postgresql/lib:$libdir'\n```\n\nOnce pgTAP is installed, you can add it to a database by connecting as a super\nuser and running:\n\n```sql\nCREATE \n...

Check out pgenv into `~/.pgenv`.\n\n    ``` sh\n    git clone https://github.com/theory/pgenv.git ~/.pgenv\n    ```\n\n2.  Add `~/.pgenv/bin` and `~/.pgenv/pgsql/bin` to your `$PATH` for access to\n    the `pgenv` command-line utility and all the programs provided by\n    PostgreSQL:\n   \n    ``` sh\n    echo 'export PATH=\"$HOME/.pgenv/bin:$HOME/.pgenv/pgsql/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bash_profile\n    ```\n\n    **Ubuntu note**: Modify your `~/.profile` instead of `~/.bash_profile`.\n\n    **Zsh note**: Modify your `~/.zshrc` file instead of `~/.bash_profile`.\n\n3.  Restart your shell as a login shell so the path changes take effect. You\n    can now begin using pgenv.\n\n    ``` sh\n    exec $SHELL -l\n    ```\n\n4.  Build a version of PostgreSQL:\n\n    ``` sh\n    pgenv build 10.4\n    ```\n\n### Configuration\n\nBy default, all versions of PostgreSQL will be built in the root of the\nproject directory (generally in `~/.pgenv`.). If you'd like them to live\nelsewhere, set the `$PGENV_ROOT` environment variable to the appropriate\ndirectory.\n\nIt is possible to configure which programs, flags and languages to build\nusing a configuration file before the program launches the build. \nFor a more detailed configuration, see the [`pgenv config`](#pgenv-config)\ncommand below.\n\nYou can use a local PostgreSQL git repo instead of downloading tarballs\nfor the build step by setting the external `$PGENV_LOCAL_POSTGRESQL_REPO`\nenvironment variable to the appropriate absolute path.\n\n### Running scripts\n\nIt is possible to run custom script when particular events happen. \nThe purpose is to let the user to configure the cluster as much as\nshe want, for instance installing extension or pre-loading data.\n\nCustom scripts are driven by a set of configuration variables as follows:\n- `PGENV_SCRIPT_POSTINSTALL` is an executable script run as soon as the `build`\nfinishes. The return value of the script does not affect the `pgenv` workflow.\nThe script gets the version of PostgreSQL being installed as first argument.\n\n-   `PGENV_SCRIPT_POSTINITDB` is \n...
