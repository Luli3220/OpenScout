Some enthusiasts have disassembled the game,\r\nfixed many bugs, and added many features. Today the game and the so-called speed fix can\r\nbe downloaded free from [here](http://www.elmerproductions.com/sp/dlinst.html). The source code for the speed fix is likewise, unavailable.\r\n\r\n**OpenSupaplex** is a 1:1 reimplementation of the original game in C and SDL, with just a few changes to make it easy to use with game controllers, and also easy to port to any platform.\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\nIf you want to build the original game from its disassembled source code, please refer to\r\nthe instructions in [cilliemalan's repo](https://github.com/cilliemalan/supaplex).\r\n\r\nOther than that, **OpenSupaplex** can be built for any of the following platforms:\r\n- macOS\r\n- Windows\r\n- Linux\r\n- PSP\r\n- PS Vita\r\n- PlayStation 2\r\n- PlayStation 3\r\n- Nintendo DS\r\n- Nintendo 3DS\r\n- Nintendo Wii\r\n- Nintendo Wii U\r\n- Nintendo Switch\r\n- RISC OS\r\n\r\nMore platforms (like Android, iOS and tvOS) to come Soon™.\r\n\r\n### Prerequisites\r\nDepending on the platform, you need to install a different toolchain to build the game for that platform.\r\nYou will also need to install the libraries needed to make it work. Those are basically SDL and SDL_mixer,\r\nand their dependencies. All ports use SDL 2, except for PSP, Nintendo DS, Nintendo 3DS, Nintendo Wii and\r\nRISC OS, which use SDL 1.2.\r\n\r\nAll platforms supported are built from CI using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/sergiou87/open-supaplex/actions). You can check [those workflows](https://github.com/sergiou87/open-supaplex/tree/master/.github/workflows)\r\nand the CI scripts used in them for more info about how to prepare the dev environment.\r\n\r\n### Building\r\nOnce the development environment is set up, building the game is usually as easy as:\r\n```\r\n$ make\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn macOS, just opening the Xcode project and running it is enough.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nIf you like this project, there are several ways you can contribute to it:\r\n- **Reporting bugs:** just file an issue in this repo, detailing the bug and how to reproduce it as much as you can.\r\nIt's even better if you can record a demo of the bug using the demo feature of the game and upload the file.\r\n- **Requesting features or ports**: again, filing an issue in this repo is the way to go, detailing what you need as much as you can.\r\n- **Submitting Pull Requests:** you can also contribute with your own code. Just, please, be mindful of the code style and project structure used\r\nalready.\r\n\r\n### Contributin\n... (truncated)"

There is a workaround to circumvent this:\n\n```objective-c\nself.navigationController.interactivePopGestureRecognizer.delegate = (id<UIGestureRecognizerDelegate>)self;\n```\n\nHowever, this may lead to some weird behavior of your app, including glitches and random crashes.\n\nTherefore, the only way I found to preserve the original behavior while having custom back buttons is [writing your own transition](http://www.objc.io/issue-5/view-controller-transitions.html).\n\n## Features\n\n- Works with custom back buttons.\n- Works with navigation bar title text custom attributes.\n- Transitions properly between view controllers with the navigation bar visible and invisible.\n\n## Limitations\n\n- It requires that you apply some attributes to the navigation bar title text.\n- It doesn't work with custom title views (yet…).\n\n## Install SPInteractivePopNavigationController\n\n1. **Using CocoaPods**\n\n  Add SPInteractivePopNavigationController to your Podfile:\n\n  ```ruby\n  platform :ios, \"7.0\"\n  pod 'SPInteractivePopNavigationController'\n  ```\n\n  Run the following command:\n\n  ```\n  pod install\n  ```\n\n2. **Manually**\n\n  Clone the project or add it as a submodule. Drag the whole SPInteractivePopNavigationController folder to your project.\n  \n  Then, you can simply do:\n\n    ```objective-c\n    #import \"SPInteractivePopNavigationController.h\"\n    ```\n\n## Usage of SPInteractivePopNavigationController\n\n### The easy way\n\nJust use the **SPInteractivePopNavigationController** (directly or inheriting it) as your navigation controller:\n\n```objective-c\nSPMyViewController *myViewController = [[SPMyViewController alloc] init];\n\nSPInteractivePopNavigationController *navigationController = [[SPInteractivePopNavigationController alloc] initWithRootViewController:myViewController];\n```\n\n### The flexible way\n\nYou don't want to use SPInteractivePopNavigationController in your code? Don't worry, it's still easy: just wire **SPPopAnimationController** and **SPHorizontalSwipeInteractionController** with your navigation controller and view controllers. An example of this wiring can be found in the class **SPInteractivePopNavigationController**.\n\n## Contact\n\nSPInteractivePopNavigationController was created by Sergio Padrino: [@sergiou87](https://twitter.com/sergiou87), based on [VCTransitionsLibrary](https://github.com/ColinEberhardt/VCTransitionsLibrary).\n\n## Contributing\n\nIf you want to contribute to the project just follow this steps:\n\n1. Fork the repository.\n2. Clone your fork\n... (truncated)"

      "README.md": "## SPDebugMenu\n\nSPDebugMenu is a library for iOS developers to show debug menus in their apps with fully customizable actions.\n\nIt supports:\n\n* Different ways to trigger it: shaking the device, multiple taps or long press on the screen.\n* Customized debug actions.\n* Send a report via e-mail with a screenshot and some useful information.\n* Simulate a memory warning notification in your device\n\n## Install\n\n1. **Using CocoaPods**\n\n  Add SPDebugMenu to your Podfile:\n\n  ```\n  platform :ios, \"6.0\"\n  pod 'SPDebugMenu'\n  ```\n\n  Run the following command:\n\n  ```\n  pod install\n  ```\n\n2. **Static Library**\n\n    Clone the project or add it as a submodule. Drag *SPDebugMenu.xcodeproj* to your project, add it as a target dependency and link *libSPDebugMenu.a*.\n    Then, you can simply do:\n\n    ```\n    #import <SPDebugMenu/SPDebugMenu.h>\n    ```\n\n3. **Manually**\n\n  Clone the project or add it as a submodule. Drag the whole SPDebugMenu folder to your project.\n\n## Usage\n\nTo enable your debug menu, you only have to instance it associated to a window and then register some triggers and actions. You can do this in your ```application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:``` method in your ```UIApplicationDelegate```:\n\n\n```objective-c\n- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions\n{\n    ...\n    self.window = ...;\n    ...\n    // Configure the debug menu\n    self.debugMenu = [[SPDebugMenu alloc] initWithWindow:self.window];\n    [self.debugMenu registerTrigger:...];\n    [self.debugMenu registerAction:...];\n    ...\n}\n```\n\n### Triggers\n\nSPDebugMenu provides some useful triggers so that you won't need to write your own except for specific cases.\n\n* ```SPDebugMenuTapTrigger``` will trigger the debug menu after detecting a specific number of taps with a specific number of touches on a view:\n```objective-c\n    SPDebugMenuTapTrigger *tapTrigger = [[SPDebugMenuTapTrigger alloc] init];\n    tapTrigger.view = self.window;            // Detect taps in the whole window\n    tapTrigger.numberOfTouchesRequired = 2;   // Two fingers required\n    tapTrigger.numberOfTapsRequired = 5;      // Five taps required\n```\n\n* ```SPDebugMenuLongPressTrigger``` will trigger the debug menu after detecting a long press gesture with a specific number of touches on a view:\n```objective-c\n    SPDebugMenuLongPressTrigger *longPressTrigger = [[SPDebugMenuLongPressTrigger alloc] init];\n    longPressTrigger.view = self.window;            // Detect taps in the whole window\n    longPressTrigger.numberOfTouchesRequired = 2;   // Two fingers required\n```\n\n* ```SPDebugMenuShakeTrigger``` will trigger the debug menu after shaking de device. This trigger requires a more sophisticated configuration with some entity (typically the window) that informs it about the shake. To make this easier, SPDebugMenu includes a ```UIWindow``` subclass called ```SPShakeTriggerWindow``` which can store a reference to a ```SPDebugMenuShakeTrigger``` and notify motion events to it\n...
