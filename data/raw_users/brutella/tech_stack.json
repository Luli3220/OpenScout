Please switch to the new [hap](https://github.com/brutella/hap) library.**\n\n---\n\n[![GoDoc Widget]][GoDoc]\n\n`hc` is a lightweight framework to develop HomeKit accessories in Go.\nIt abstracts the **H**omeKit **A**ccessory **P**rotocol (HAP) and makes it easy to work with [services](service/README.md) and [characteristics](characteristic/README.md).\n\n`hc` handles the underlying communication between HomeKit accessories and clients.\nYou can focus on implementing the business logic for your accessory, without having to worry about the protocol.\n\nHere are some projects which use `hc`.\n\n- [hkknx](https://hochgatterer.me/hkknx)\n- [hkcam](https://github.com/brutella/hkcam)\n- [hklifx](https://github.com/brutella/hklifx/)\n- [hkuvr](https://github.com/brutella/hkuvr)\n- [hksymo](https://github.com/brutella/hksymo)\n\n**What is HomeKit?**\n\n[HomeKit][homekit] is a set of protocols and libraries from Apple. It is used by Apple's platforms to communicate with smart home appliances. A non-commercial version of the documentation is now available on the [HomeKit developer website](https://developer.apple.com/homekit/).\n\nHomeKit is fully integrated into iOS since iOS 8. Developers can use [HomeKit.framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/homekit) to communicate with accessories using high-level APIs.\n\n<img alt=\"Home+.app\" src=\"_img/home-icon.png?raw=true\" width=\"87\" />\n\nI've developed the [Home+][home+] app to control HomeKit accessories from iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch.\nIf you want to support `hc`, please purchase Home from the [App Store][home-appstore]. That would be awesome. ❤️\n\nCheckout the official [website][home+].\n\n[home+]: https://hochgatterer.me/home/\n[home-appstore]: http://itunes.apple.com/app/id995994352\n[GoDoc]: https://godoc.org/github.com/brutella/hc\n[GoDoc Widget]: https://godoc.org/github.com/brutella/hc?status.svg\n\n## Features\n\n- Supports Go modules (requires Go 1.13)\n- Full implementation of the HAP in Go\n- Supports all HomeKit [services and characteristics](service/README.md)\n- Built-in service announcement via DNS-SD using [dnssd](http://github.com/brutella/dnssd)\n- Runs on linux and macOS\n- Documentation: http://godoc.org/github.com/brutella/hc\n\n## Getting Started\n\n1. [Install](http://golang.org/doc/install) and [set up](http://golang.org/doc/code.html#Organization) Go\n2. Create your own HomeKit accessory or clone an existing one (e.g.  [hklight](https://github.com/brutella/hklight))\n\n        cd $GOPATH/src\n\n        # Clone project\n        git clone https://github.com/brutella/hklight && cd hklight\n\n        # Run the project\n        make run\n\n3. Pair with your HomeKit App of choice (e.g. [Home][home-appstore])\n\n**Go Modules**\n\n`hc` supports [Go module](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules) since `v1.0.0`.\nMake sure to set the environment variable `GO111MODULE=on`.\n\n## Example\n\nSee [_example](_example) for a variety of examples.\n\n**Basic switch accessory**\n\nCrea\n...

      "README.md": "# hkcam\n\n`hkcam` is an open-source implementation of an HomeKit IP camera. \nIt uses `ffmpeg` to access the camera stream and publishes the stream to HomeKit using [hap](https://github.com/brutella/hap).\nThe camera stream can be viewed in a HomeKit app. For example my [Home+](https://hochgatterer.me/home) app works perfectly with `hkcam`.\n\n<img alt=\"Camera Stream\" src=\"_img/home-app-camera.jpeg?raw=true\" width=\"400\" />\n\n## Features\n\n- Live streaming via HomeKit\n- Works with any HomeKit app (ex. [Home+](https://hochgatterer.me/home))\n- [Multistream Support](#multistream)\n- [Persistent Snapshots](#persistent-snapshots)\n- [Built-in Web Interface](#web-interface)\n- Runs on multiple platforms (Raspberry Pi OS, macOS)\n\n## Get Started\n\n*hkcam uses Go modules and therefore requires Go 1.11 or higher.*\n\n### Mac\n\nThe fastest way to get started is to\n\n1. download the project on a Mac with a built-in iSight camera\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/brutella/hkcam && cd hkcam\n```\n2. build and run `cmd/hkcam/main.go` by running `task hkcam` in Terminal\n3. open any HomeKit app and add the camera to HomeKit (pin for initial setup is `001 02 003`)\n3. view the web ui by entering the url http://localhost:8080\n\nThese steps require *git*, *go*, *task* and *ffmpeg* to be installed. On macOS you can install them via Homebrew.\n\n```sh\nbrew install git\nbrew install go\nbrew install go-task/tap/go-task\nbrew install ffmpeg\n```\n\n### Raspberry Pi\n\nYou can use a camera module or USB camera with a Raspberry Pi to create your own surveillance camera.\n\n<img alt=\"ELP 1080p\" src=\"_img/elp-1080p.jpg?raw=true\" width=\"280\" />\n\nFor example the [ELP 1080P USB camera dome](https://de.aliexpress.com/item/4000562253329.html) is great for outdoor use. It is IP66 waterproof and has built-in IR LEDs for night vision. This camera gets you good quality and great performance when running `hkcam` on the latest Raspberry Pi OS.\n\nA cheaper alternative is a [camera module](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/camera-module-v2/) attached via ribbon cable. You'll have to enable **[Legacy Camera Support](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/accessories/camera.html#libcamera-and-the-legacy-raspicam-camera-stack)** when using a camera module on Raspberry Pi OS. That's why this option is not ideal in my opinion.\n\n---\n\n**How to Install on a Raspberry Pi?**\n\nFollow these steps to install `hkcam` and all the required libraries on a Raspberry Pi OS Lite (32-bit).\n\n1. Download and run the Raspberry Pi Imager from https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/\n<img alt=\"Raspberry Pi Imager\" src=\"_img/rpi-imager.png?raw=true\" width=\"400\" />\n\n- Choose OS → Raspberry Pi OS (other) → Raspberry Pi OS Lite (32-bit)\n<img alt=\"Raspberry Pi Imager\" src=\"_img/rpi-imager-os.png?raw=true\" width=\"400\" />\n\n- Insert a sd card into your computer and choose it as the storage\n<img alt=\"Raspberry Pi Imager\" src=\"_img/rpi-imager-storage.png?raw=true\" width=\"400\" />\n\n- Click on the settings icon and **enable SSH**, **Set username and pas\n...

      "README.md": "# ChatHeads\n\nChatHeads is a new feature in [Facebook.app 6.0](http://www.theverge.com/2013/4/16/4230274/facebook-6-0-for-ipad-and-iphone-hands-on-with-chat-heads-stickers) where little bubbles appear in the iOS app when somebody sends you a message. It's a nice little feature and uses very cool animations.\n\nThis project is an attempt to re-implement this feature and to figure out how the animations are done. \nI don't support this project in a way to completely implement all features of ChatHeads. It should only illustrate how parts of ChatHeads are done.\n\n## Make it Build\n\nDon't forget to run `git submodule update --init` before building the project. I've added [SKBounceAnimation][SKBounceAnimation-link] and [CAAnimationBlocks](https://github.com/xissburg/CAAnimationBlocks) in the last update.\n\n## The Design\n\nChatHeads in Facebook.app are little bubbles which show the Friends avatar. They can be dragged around and will snap to the left or right screen edge if they are released. If a ChatHead bubble is pressed, the conversation view appears and the bubbles are arranged at the top of the screen.\n\nThe goal of this project was to implement the interaction (drag and release, pressing) with the ChatHead bubbles as well as the animations.\n\n### Interaction Concept\n\nChatHead bubbles are always snapped to the left or right screen edge. They are partially moved outside of the screen to not cover too much space. The bubbles can be dragged around the screen and will always snap to the screen edge based on where they are released.\n\n![](Resources/Interaction.png)\n\nAll animations have nice bounce effects to make them feel more natural. For example when releasing a ChatHead in the center of the screen, the bubble will snap to the edge and bounce back and forth.\n\n![](Resources/Animation.png)\n\nThe animation bounce depends on the speed so when a bubble moves very fast it also bounce much more. \n\n### Animations\n\nI've tried to implement all animations similar to the Facebook.app and make them feel the same. There are a lot of small animations which I had overlooked at first. Here are some explained in more detail.\n\n#### Touching and Dragging\n\nWhen a bubble is touched, it's scaled down to give a nice feeling of depth. \nWhen the bubble is released or dragged it gets scaled up again with a nice bounce animation.\n\n[Video](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2187517/Uploads/ChatHeads/touch.m4v)\n\n#### Dragging and Releasing\n\nThe bubbles can be dragged anywhere on the screen and doesn't block the underlyng UI. After releasing the bubble, it gets moved to the snap position. At the end of the animation, there is a little bounce effect. The intensity of the bounce effect depends on the distance between the release and destination location. \n\n[Video](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2187517/Uploads/ChatHeads/move.m4v)\n\n#### Pressing\n\nIf a bubble is pressed (touched but not moved), it gets moved to the top of the screen and a new view appears below it.
