Install it from CRAN:\n\n```{r}\ninstall.packages(\"GGally\")\n```\n\nYou can also install `ggnet` and `ggnet2` as a small standalone package:\n\n```{r}\ndevtools::install_github(\"briatte/ggnet\")\n```\n\nNote that you will need the latest version of [`ggplot2`](http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/) (2.0.0) for any of the functions to work properly.\n\n## VIGNETTE\n\nThe `ggnet2` function is fully documented in [this vignette](https://briatte.github.io/ggnet/).\n\nThe data for one of the examples, a Twitter network of French Members of Parliament, is [included in this repository](inst/extdata), as is the [vignette source](vignettes).\n\n## THANKS\n\n- [Moritz Marbach](https://github.com/sumtxt) coded the [very first version of `ggnet`](http://sumtxt.wordpress.com/2011/07/02/visualizing-networks-with-ggplot2-in-r/)\n- [Heike Hoffmann](https://github.com/heike) and [Ming-Yu Liu](https://github.com/ethen8181) provided code to improve the display of edge arrows\n- [Pedro Jordano](https://github.com/pedroj) suggested adding support for [bipartite networks](https://github.com/pedroj/bipartite_plots)\n- [Baptiste Coulmont](http://coulmont.com/index.php?s=d%C3%A9put%C3%A9s) and [Ewen Gallic](http://freakonometrics.blog.free.fr/index.php?post/Twitter-deputes) provided further inspiration\n- [Barret Schloerke](https://github.com/schloerke) helps by maintaining the `GGally` package\n"

The course is [online][ida].\n\n[ivo]: http://ipetev.org/\n[fr]: http://f.briatte.org/\n[ida]: http://f.briatte.org/teaching/ida/\n\nIf you are reading the course on its [online pages][ida], just replace the `.html` extension of a page by `.R` to download the underlying code. \n\n## HOWTO\n\nThe course pages are formatted in R Markdown syntax and were converted to HTML with [knitr][knitr] 1.4:\n\n[knitr]: http://yihui.name/knitr/\n\n    install.packages(\"knitr\")\n    citation(\"knitr\")\n\nThe knitting routine is in the [`.Rprofile`](.Rprofile). To compile the whole course, set the `IDA` folder as your working directory and then type `ida.build()` (takes a bit more than five minutes on optic fiber).\n\nOther files are called from the [`code/`](https://github.com/briatte/ida/blob/master/code/README.md) and [`data/`](https://github.com/briatte/ida/blob/master/data/README.md) folders. Most datasets are downloaded on the fly if they are missing from the `data/` folder, so make sure that you are online while running the scripts.\n\nThe whole course was coded and taught with [RStudio][rs]. The code was ran on R 2.15.2, 2.15.3, 3.0.0 and 3.0.1, on a MacBook Air running OS X 10.8 and Mac OS X 10.9. Most plots use [ggplot2][gg] version 0.9.3.1 (just in case compatibility breaks at some point).\n\n[rs]: http://www.rstudio.com/\n[gg]: http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/\n\n## CREDITS\n\nThanks to the [Sciences Po Reims][spr] staff, who offered invaluable support, and to the small group of students who enrolled in (and survived to) the course. The [R-2013-Lyon](R-2013-Lyon) slides have a bit more detail on the practicals.\n\n[spr]: http://college.sciences-po.fr/sitereims/\n\nBits and pieces of the code were posted to [Gist][gist], [RPubs][rpubs] and [Stack Overflow][so] during development. Thanks to the great R developer and user communities that live online, and which we are now proud to count ourselves in.\n\n[gist]: https://gist.github.com/briatte\n[rpubs]: http://rpubs.com/briatte\n[so]: http://stackoverflow.com/\n\nIf you share the spirit of all this, you should consider joining the [Foundation for Open Access Statistics][foas] and check out places like [OpenCPU][ocpu], the [Open Knowledge Foundation][okfn] and other initiatives in open access, open data, open source and open science.\n\n[foas]: http://www.foastat.org/\n[ocpu]: https://public.opencpu.org/\n[okfn]: http://okfn.org/\n\n## HISTORY\n\n__Aug 2013__: better data management, with large or multiple-file datasets read from ZIP archives. Switched datasets to `.csv` [thanks to GitHub](https://github.com/blog/1601-see-your-csvs).\n\n__Jul 2013__: typos and broken links. Removed some functions in `.Rprofile` that are now [part of](https://github.com/juba/questionr/blob/master/R/utils.r) the `questionr` package.\n\n__Jun-2013__: first draft. Everything kind of works, Sessions 5--7 are unlisted, the `code/` folder contains a few more\n... (truncated)"
